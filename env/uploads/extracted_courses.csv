A liberal education also prepares students for informed and reflective participation in society, for sustained cultural and aesthetic enjoyment, and for a lifetime of learning. Mission Statement The College of Arts and Sciences promotes discovery and learning by students and faculty in the sciences, the humanities, and the arts. Firmly grounded in a tradition of rigorous disciplinary inquiry, the College also recognizes the value of connections made across disciplinary boundaries and so supports and encourages interdisciplinary and collaborative scholarship and teaching. The College is dedicated to the liberal arts mission of higher education, which is to develop the knowledge and understanding needed by citizens of a free and just society. The College faculty are committed to offering courses and programs that prepare students to meet the challenges they will face throughout their lives by emphasizing skills of reasoning, writing, speaking, and independent thinking. Dean's Welcome Welcome to The College of Arts & Sciences at The University of North Carolina at Greensboro. We are the largest of the university’s seven academic units, with 19 departments and six interdepartmental programs that encompass the arts, humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, and mathematics. Through this diversity of offerings, the College provides an education that will give you the skills and knowledge needed for success in the complex and changing world you will face after graduation. No matter where your career takes you, it will be important to remain flexible and conﬁdent of your ability to succeed throughout your working life. Employers are interested in people with flexible skills and a wide- ranging, multidisciplinary perspective. This is just what the College of Arts & Sciences has designed its curriculum to provide. The 21st century world may be full of unexpected challenges, but your experience here will prepare you to embrace those challenges as well as the opportunities they bring with them. There are a number of ways in which faculty and staff guide your intellectual development so that you can succeed in your studies and prepare for the wide variety of career paths that will be open to you. We emphasize, for example, strong writing and speaking skills, critical thinking, international understanding, research and other “hands- on” experience. As you gain deeper knowledge in your major, you’ll be encouraged to also explore electives across a variety of subjects. Therefore, becoming conversant in more than one ﬁeld is another important beneﬁt of your time in the College. Across all of the College’s academic programs, our renowned faculty members share a deep commitment to advancing discovery and learning; they bring that commitment both to classroom settings and to hands- on experiences such as research and internships. Your professors will be accomplished researchers, scholars, and artists, many with national and international reputations. At the same time, they are enthusiastic and dedicated teachers. Whatever the setting, their teaching and mentoring is informed and enlivened by their personal involvement in discovering new knowledge, exploring new artistic forms, or applying the results of research in new contexts. I invite you to explore the College and what a learning experience here might mean for you. Each of our departments and programs (https:// aas.uncg.edu/departments/) has its own web site. You’ll ﬁnd that by maintaining strong programs of research and scholarship, the College faculty work to advance our understanding of fundamental problems facing society today. You, too, will be able to use the knowledge and skills you learn here to succeed in the paths you take after graduation, enriching your own life while contributing to society. John Z.

We are ﬁrmly committed to the pursuit of anthropological knowledge, and we challenge students to explore the diversity of human experience critically and holistically, both in the past and present. The faculty is committed to advancing foundational anthropological ethics such as the value of human diversity, cultural tolerance, and respect for the practice of different lifeways across the globe. We provide students with the knowledge and skills necessary to accomplish their personal goals whether they pursue advanced graduate study or the practical application of anthropological knowledge in the workplace. Anthropology coursework is designed to foster the critical thinking skills necessary to devise realistic solutions, public policy, and effective interventions to address both local and international economic, environmental, health, political, and social problems. This is achieved by incorporating students in active research programs that provide real-world, hands-on experiences and nurture creative problem-solving skills and examples that promote responsible community engagement, heritage conservation, and service. About Anthropology is a broad discipline which includes biological anthropology —the study of humans as biological animals; cultural anthropology—the study of humankind in a cultural perspective; archaeology—the recovery and interpretation of ancient human cultural remains; and linguistics—the study of language in culture and society. The undergraduate major provides for extensive study in cultural anthropology, archaeology, and biological anthropology. Majors who develop a particular interest in one of the subdisciplines may pursue a concentration in that area, or they may choose to take electives in multiple sub-ﬁelds. Majors have opportunities to work closely with members of the faculty on current research projects in the lab and in the ﬁeld. Internships in various agencies are also available. Anthropology as a major prepares individuals to pursue many avenues of career development. It is the basis for a career as a professional anthropologist. Anthropology combined with other courses of study as double majors enhances career possibilities and professional development. There are, moreover, increasing opportunities for anthropologists to work in government agencies, non-proﬁts, and business. In such settings, anthropological knowledge of biology, culture, and long term patterns of cultural change may be applied to the solution of human problems.

The program presents a holistic view of humans interacting in society and with their environments to explore cultural and biological change through time. The impact of social, political, economic, health and environmental factors on modern, multi-ethnic populations across the globe, including the United States, is emphasized. Through courses in anthropological archaeology, biological anthropology, and cultural anthropology the Anthropology Major enriches a foundational liberal arts education and prepares students to pursue professional careers in our diverse, multi-cultural world, or graduate or professional studies. Building Knowledge, Obtaining Life-Long Skills The Anthropology Major is designed to create globally aware, life-long learners with critical thinking and communication skills necessary to be successful in an ever-shifting marketplace of ideas, technology, and employment. Coursework in Anthropology offers students high-impact, hands-on research opportunities, problem-solving, written and oral communication, social agility, and cultural competence. Anthropology faculty bring their research, which is based in Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America, and the US, into the classroom and offer courses in primatology, human evolution, race and biological diversity, forensics, historic and prehistoric archaeology, community responses to crisis and disaster, public health, medical anthropology, environmental anthropology, economics, politics, gender, and social inequality. The program welcomes all second majors or minors seeking to enrich their program of study. Overall Requirements • 120 credit hours, to include at least 36 credits at or above the 300 course level. • All anthropology majors must complete a minimum of 37 credits in anthropology with an overall GPA in the major of at least a 2.0, including the courses as listed below. • Although not a requirement beyond the 37 credit minimum, majors may choose to take additional courses in any of the subdisciplines: Archaeology, Cultural Anthropology, or Biological Anthropology.

The Department of Biology Department offers a 30 credit-hour Master of Science (M.S.) program that prepare students for careers in the biological sciences or that draw on the biological sciences. The M.S. thesis option not only provides career preparation, but also provides a strong foundation for further academic training, such as medical school or a doctoral program. Students select an advisor who helps them select an advisory committee that works closely with each student to tailor a speciﬁc curriculum to meet that student’s needs and interests and to guide their thesis work. Students typically complete the necessary course work and research thesis for the master’s degree in 2-3 years. The M.S. non-thesis option is based on preparing students for a broad array of careers that draw on expertise in the biological sciences. Non- thesis students will generally select 27 credits of electives from graduate- level biology courses but may include up to 12 credits of graduate courses in other programs. Non-thesis students will complete a 3 credit capstone experience and will select an advisor to work closely with them on tailoring a speciﬁc curriculum and capstone experience to meet that student’s needs and interests. The non-thesis option can be completed in 1-2 years.

Duffy, Graduate Program Director Undergraduate Programs The Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry offers ﬁve undergraduate programs: the Bachelor of Science in Chemistry, the Bachelor of Science in Biochemistry, the Bachelor of Science in Chemistry with a Concentration in Biochemistry, the Bachelor of Science in Chemistry with a Concentration in Research, and the Bachelor of Arts in Chemistry. A licensure program to prepare students to teach high school chemistry is offered. The Master of Science in Chemistry, Master of Science in Chemistry with Biochemistry Concentration, and Ph.D. in Chemistry and Biochemistry are offered at the graduate level (see the University Catalog). Students who follow the program leading to the Bachelor of Science in Chemistry degree are certiﬁed to the American Chemical Society as having met its rigorous requirements for undergraduate professional training in chemistry. The Department’s biochemistry programs (B.S. in Biochemistry and B.S. in Chemistry with Concentration in Biochemistry) provide students with excellent preparation for graduate work in biochemistry and related life sciences, as well as for employment in chemical and biotechnological industries. These programs are also attractive to students planning careers in the medical, dental, or pharmaceutical professions. The department emphasizes the opportunity for students to engage in undergraduate research. Many of our majors do so, principally in their junior and senior years, and this provides excellent training for those who intend to continue their studies at the graduate level. Graduate Programs UNC Greensboro has a tradition of excellence in advanced training for careers in the chemical and biochemical sciences. Our faculty is committed to providing one-on-one learning opportunities for all our students in the laboratory, and this dedication to quality graduate education translates into very high success rates for our graduates as they pursue careers in science. Our Department has a strong research emphasis on Medicinal Biochemistry, and our students engage in a diverse array of research projects related to that theme. For example, students work to develop or synthesize new drug candidates, identify and study mechanism of action of natural products, or explore the chemical properties of human drug metabolizing systems. In support of these efforts, our department is home to the Medicinal Chemistry Collaborative (MC2) directed by Dr. Nadja Cech and Dr. Nicholas Oberlies. The mission of this center is to broaden the impact of natural products and drug discovery research on the UNC Greensboro campus, and to facilitate university-industry relationships with local pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. The Department has a well-established Master’s level program that offers an M.S. in Chemistry within which a Concentration in Biochemistry can be chosen. These are very well-rounded terminal degree programs. In addition to course-work in core areas of Chemistry or Biochemistry, each program emphasizes training in research by requiring a signiﬁcant research project with a Master’s thesis under the supervision of a professor. Students also receive experience in professional presentation through the seminar program and attendance at professional meetings to present research results. Our Ph.D. program in Chemistry and Biochemistry is unique in the state of North Carolina. Target-based rational drug design, with its emphasis on biochemical and molecular biological receptors, is now central to the development of new and more effective pharmaceuticals. The Ph.D. program offers students an innovative curriculum and research environment that emphasizes fundamental biochemical interactions and mechanisms guiding drug design and development.  Students who complete the program will have a strong biochemical perspective on drug design, discovery, and function, and will have specialization in any of several disciplines which connect biochemical interactions with pharmaceutical development: computational chemistry, bioanalytical chemistry, biophysical chemistry, natural product isolation, molecular biology and enzymology, or drug synthesis.

UNC Greensboro 2023-24 University Catalog 325 Classical Studies College of Arts and Sciences 1104 Moore Humanities and Research Administration 336-334-5214 www.uncg.edu/cla (http://www.uncg.edu/cla/) Maura K. Heyn, Department Head and Director of Undergraduate Studies Mission Statement Our program offers students the opportunity to engage with the diverse peoples and cultures of the ancient Mediterranean world. This engagement encourages students to reflect upon the past in order to bridge time and distance in pursuit of answers to fundamental questions about what it means to be human. Students grapple with the origins of urban life; ancient Mediterranean systems of belief and myth; ancient cosmology; the meaning of the major monuments, literature, and artifacts from the Mediterranean region; Roman law; the lives of women in Antiquity; ancient Greek and Latin languages, and much more. This breadth of courses fosters intellectual curiosity and allows students to consider multiple viewpoints, understand different methodologies, and engage in creative inquiry across disciplines. The study of the ancient Mediterranean world at UNC Greensboro has been a foundational discipline since the college ﬁrst opened its doors in 1891, when all students studied Greek and Roman history, and three years of Latin were required for graduation. While Classical Studies has been part of UNC Greensboro’s curriculum for over 125 years, the discipline, like the university, has grown and expanded and changed. Students in Classical Studies now engage with a vast and interconnected cultural diversity that spanned the entire ancient Mediterranean world, a diversity which in many ways reflects the diversity of the student body at UNC Greensboro. About The Department of Classical Studies provides a comprehensive approach to the study of the ancient Greek and Roman world. The Department believes that students should have a solid foundation in the language, history, and culture of Greek and Roman civilization. To this end, the program is designed to ensure that all students gain proﬁciency in the Greek or Latin language, as well as a broad understanding of Classical literature in its cultural and historical context, the influence of Graeco- Roman civilization on the conceptions and values of Western civilization, and the methods of critical inquiry which are central to the discipline of Classical Studies. The Department offers a wide variety of courses in English on mythology, archaeology, literature and culture, as well as courses in ancient Greek and Latin at all levels. Courses with a CCI preﬁx require no knowledge of either language; GRK courses require reading of texts in Greek and LAT courses require reading of texts in Latin. Students also have an opportunity in the summer to visit Athens, Rome, and other parts of the Classical world, to participate in archaeological excavation, and to earn semester hours of credit through the following or through Study Abroad Programs. Professor Maura Keane HeynG Joanne M. MurphyG Associate Professor David B WhartonG Jonathan P. ZareckiG Assistant Professor Robyn Le Blanc Michiel Christiaan Van Veldhuizen Lecturer Aisha Dad-Van Veldhuizen Georgios Doudalis Derek Smith Keyser G  Graduate-level faculty • Classical Studies, B.A. (p. 325) • Classical Studies Undergraduate Minor (p. 327) • Classical Studies Second Academic Concentration (p. 327) Classical Studies, B.A. The Department offers a B.A. in Classical Studies, with three distinct concentrations in Classical Language and Literature, Classical Civilization, and Classical Archaeology. All three concentrations offer a broad liberal arts experience that provides an excellent foundation for a variety of careers including law, business, government, journalism, and teaching. The Classical Language and Literature concentration is designed to ensure a solid preparation in the chosen language and to acquaint students with those works that form the origin of European literature, history, and philosophy. This concentration prepares students for graduate work in the Classical languages and literature and for secondary school language teaching. The Classical Civilization and Classical Archaeology concentrations provide a solid and wide-ranging background for understanding the origin and development of our Western ideas, values, languages, institutions, attitudes, and art. The Classical Civilization concentration is an excellent major for Prelaw students, who should choose courses on Roman Civilization (CCI 101), Roman Law and Society (CCI 350), and Latin to fulﬁll major requirements. It is also an excellent second major for those interested in any area of primary or secondary school teaching. The Classical Archaeology concentration is intended especially for students wishing to pursue graduate work in Classical Archaeology. Students interested in other areas of archaeology should also consider the Liberal and Interdisciplinary Studies Major: Archaeology Concentration.

Meaning making is a complex, continuous, collaborative, dynamic process. Sometimes, we are transported into a world we could hardly imagine as we engage in deep listening and active dialogue with friends, loved ones, and colleagues. Sometimes a great speech will take us to soaring heights of understanding and even epiphany. Sometimes we are like ships passing in the night, hardly even understanding one another. And sometimes, we crash into each other like rams on a hillside, embroiled in conflict, with no apparent exit! Friends, families, work groups, organizations, communities—we study them all, and all offer endless opportunities for study, sense making, and intervention. All of this action, and more, will confront you as you engage in your studies. And, at the end of it all, you will not only have a lifelong quest ahead of you (as you come to understand and engage in various forms and practices of communication), you will also ﬁnd yourself equipped to succeed in a wide variety of ﬁelds and careers. Mission Statement We teach and research communication to connect people, create change, and work toward a just world. Commitments • We engage communication knowledge to understand, advance, and challenge human interaction processes locally and globally. • We promote the centrality of communication to personal, professional, and public lives. • We seek to invigorate our collective moral imagination to build a world of hope, justice, and peace. • We engage pressing social and relational issues through written and spoken communication, active research and teaching, and involvement in the world around us. • We foster learning and application of communication knowledge and skill to transform relationships and communities. • We afﬁrm, practice, and teach service and community engagement. • We teach the art of living well together. Values We actively value and promote: • Honesty • Trust • Respect • Fairness • Responsibility • Care • Ethics • Justice • Courage • Equality • Creativity • Compassion • Engagement • Critical Thinking • Holistic Thinking • Incremental Thinking • Learner-centered practice • Independence • Interdependence • Difference • Relationships • Connection • Self-discipline • Focus • Service Philosophy of Scholarship We believe that communication is formative and foundational to human identities, relationships, and communities—and that ethical and strategically effective communication can be the means of critiquing, constructing, and transforming identities, relationships, and communities. We engage in communication scholarship in the form of research, teaching, and service that: • Integrates dialogue and other approaches to communication as the foundation for scholarly inquiry and application to the world • Cultivates diversity and respect for differences • Promotes change that leads to more democratic, just, and peaceful relationships and communities • Engages creative partnerships of faculty, students, and other stakeholders in addressing contemporary challenges and opportunities for improving communication The Department offers the B.A. in Communication Studies as well as an undergraduate minor. The M.A. degree is also offered in the department. For details on the graduate program see the University Catalog. The Department of Communication Studies offers required and elective courses that are designed to make productive use of differing learning styles among students: theoretical and applied, textual and experiential, topical and case study, course work and internships/service learning, individual and groups/team based performances. A number of courses involve service learning to link communication, action, and academic study. The Department of Communication Studies provides opportunities to study relational, group, workplace, and community communication. Communication courses contribute to a liberal education by teaching creative thinking and problem-solving, critical reasoning, and effective oral, written, and mediated communication. The faculty strongly believe in the interdisciplinary nature of communication, and this curriculum encourages elective course work be taken in allied disciplines such as African American and African Diaspora Studies, Anthropology, Business,  330 Communication Studies, B.A. English, Media Studies, Philosophy, Political Science, Psychology, Sociology, and Women’s and Gender Studies. Additionally, the Department participates in high-impact educational experiences, such as Service- Learning, the Honors Programs administered by the Lloyd International Honors College, Writing Across the Curriculum and Speaking Across the Curriculum programs, and regularly offers freshman seminars. Opportunities also exist for Study Abroad including exchanges in Europe. Communication Studies majors with a 3.0 GPA may apply to go abroad in the spring semester of their junior year to participate in various Study Abroad opportunities. The undergraduate program in Communication Studies is designed to serve as a solid foundation for a variety of professional and entrepreneurial careers; it also provides preparatory work for graduate studies in communication, as well as related ﬁelds such as law, business, media studies, and education. Faculty and students in the Department of Communication Studies are actively involved in research, service, and consulting with community, state, regional, national, and international organizations and agencies. Student Learning Goals As a reflection of the mission statement, the UNC Greensboro general education goals, and in consultation with the National Communication Association, the Department of Communication Studies has the following student learning outcomes for the B.A. degree. At the completion of the major, the student should be able to: • Speak effectively and ethically to a public. • Utilize communication concepts and competencies to build relationships and/or community. • Apply a communication perspective to identify and analyze social issues/problems. • Engage communication scholarship using appropriate theory and research methods. Graduate Programs The Master of Arts program in Communication Studies prepares students for scholarly or applied communication careers in the social, public, and private sectors, community college teaching, or advancement to a doctoral program. As they master the tools of scholarship, students acquire: 1. A deep, research-based, critical understanding of communication in relation to public and private contexts and issues, and 2. The ability to participate in and contribute to the communication discipline as scholars and practitioners. Professor Pete KellettG Etsuko KinefuchiG Loreen Nyla OlsonG Christopher N.

Students are exposed to various programming languages and computing systems. The job market in computer science is strong. A student completing a bachelor’s degree with a strong academic record can expect job offers as a systems programmer or analyst, applications programmer, systems support staff member, technical staff member, or similar position. The undergraduate curriculum has also been designed to prepare students for graduate studies (master’s and doctoral degrees) in computer science. Qualiﬁed students who have an interest in research will have opportunities to participate in projects with department faculty during undergraduate or graduate studies. Graduate About The Master of Science is designed to build computer science depth and research competence, to prepare students for advanced careers in computing ﬁelds. Students completing the M.S. degree are also well- prepared for doctoral study in computer science. M.S. students may pursue an optional concentration in Data Science and Big Data, which provides students key knowledge of appropriate theories, algorithms, and technologies, towards development of analytical systems/models for disparate, complex, and small/large scale datasets. Students completing this concentration will have demonstrated skills necessary to tackle a wide variety of data-focused scientiﬁc, social, and environmental challenges.

The courses in the Computer Science Department are designed to teach the foundations of computing rather than a particular technology, so that the student is prepared to adapt to changing technology. Students are exposed to various programming languages and computing systems. The job market in computer science is strong. A student completing a bachelor's degree with a strong academic record can expect job offers as a systems programmer or analyst, applications programmer, systems support staff member, technical staff member, or similar positions. The undergraduate curriculum has also been designed to prepare students for graduate studies (master's and doctoral degrees) in computer science. Qualiﬁed students who have an interest in research will have opportunities to participate in projects with department faculty during undergraduate or graduate studies. In addition to the regular B.S. program, students may pursue a concentration in Data Science and Big Data, which is designed to provide Computer Science B.S. students with key knowledge of appropriate theories, algorithms, and technologies, towards development of  UNC Greensboro 2023-24 University Catalog 335 analytical systems/models for disparate, complex, and small/large scale datasets. Students completing this concentration will have learned skills necessary to tackle a wide variety of data-focused scientiﬁc, social, and environmental challenges. Because computer science courses change rapidly, it is recommended that the sequence CSC 130, CSC 230, CSC 330 be completed within 4 consecutive semesters. The B.S. degree in Computer Science program is accredited by the Computing Accreditation Commission of ABET (www.abet.org (http:// www.abet.org)). Overall Requirements • 120 credit hours, to include at least 36 credits at or above the 300 course level • Students must maintain a grade point average of at least 2.0 in the core courses, required electives, and required supporting discipline courses.

At least 15 credits of electives must be at the 700- level. Students may select courses from other departments with approval of the Graduate Program Director. Advisory Committee Each student will have an advisory/dissertation committee, consisting of at least four members of the graduate faculty, who shall assist the student with the preparation of the plan of study and shall guide and evaluate the doctoral dissertation. This committee will be appointed by the Dean of Graduate Education upon the recommendation of the Computer Science Graduate Program Director and must be mutually acceptable to the student and all committee members. The committee chair must be a graduate faculty member in the Department of Computer Science and at most, one committee member may come from outside the Department of Computer Science. If appropriate to the student’s dissertation research, one member may be from outside the department or outside the university (any member from outside UNC Greensboro must be approved by the university as adjunct graduate faculty). The student must request the appointment of this committee no later than upon completion of the ﬁrst 18 credits of graduate course work. Any subsequent changes in the advisory/dissertation committee must be approved by the Graduate Program Director and submitted to the Graduate School for approval. Seminar Attendance and Participation Ph.D. students are expected to become part of an active scholarly community with other students and faculty in the department. As such, all students are expected to attend all departmental research talks and present at least one public research talk in addition to their dissertation proposal and defense. Students must track attendance at talks using a department-determined process, such as an attendance log. Qualifying Exam • Part 1: Based on core courses taken by the student • Part 2: Ph.D. dissertation proposal Part 1 of qualifying exam is a written exam based on the core courses the student has taken. It is offered twice per year: a regular exam offering in May (after Spring classes conclude) and a “make-up exam” offering in the early part of the Fall semester. This part of the qualifying exam will consist of three individual area exams, corresponding to the three core areas in the table above, and each area exam will be designed to be three hours long. Area exams will be scheduled over a period of two weeks. Content will be determined by faculty responsible for the core courses taken by the student. If a student fails an area exam for any of the core areas in the regular exam offering, a second and ﬁnal chance will be given to retake the failed area exam(s) at the make-up date. Part 2 is intended to evaluate students research aptitude. In consultation with the student’s advisor, the student thoroughly surveys a research area and prepares a written proposal for his/her dissertation that puts the proposed research in the context of previous work. Then an oral exam is held during which the student presents the proposal to the advisory committee, who evaluates and assigns a grade (pass/fail). A failing student is given a second and ﬁnal chance. Students must have demonstrated participation in the department’s scholarly community by documenting attendance at 9 or more department research talks before being eligible for presenting their dissertation proposal. Dissertation Defense With the approval of the advisor, the student submits the dissertation to Graduate School. The dissertation defense is then conducted by the advisory committee. Students with a B.S. in Computer Science or Related Discipline Students with a B.S. in Computer Science or a related discipline can apply for admission to the Ph.D. in Computer Science. The minimum credit hour requirement for the Ph.D. for these students is 72 credits. The  340 Computer Science, Ph.D. admissions committee can require students with inadequate preparation, who are otherwise qualiﬁed, to take additional courses (in addition to the minimum 72 credits). Normally, these students will spend at least one year (2 semesters) in preparation for the Ph.D. program. These students may register for CSC 701 at the beginning of their second year. Students who complete the M.S. program may receive a “pass through master’s” after passing phase 1 of their qualifying exam.

This Council for the Accreditation of Educator Preparation (CAEP) and North Carolina Department of Public Instruction (NCDPI) accredited program has an excellent placement record. It is designed for students who want to teach high school English, although majors often go on to graduate school in English or other professional schools such as law, medicine, or education. The preparation for English education is rigorous so future teachers become well informed about theory and practice and concerned about diversity, community, and their ongoing professional growth. Graduates also experience success and flexibility in careers as diverse as writing, publishing, journalism, broadcasting and marketing, as well  344 English, Secondary Education, B.A. as educational administration, law, business, library and information science, health care, politics and more.

Three plans of study beyond the core requirements are offered: 1. Thesis Plan 2. Teaching Composition Plan 3. Careers in the Humanities Plan Application and Admission Qualiﬁed UNC Greensboro undergraduate students may apply for admission to the Accelerated Master's Program (AMP) in English. A cumulative undergraduate GPA of at least 3.5 based on at least 30 credits earned at UNC Greensboro is required. Applicants must have completed at least 60 credits and may not apply for admission to the AMP before the ﬁrst semester of the junior year. English has the following additional requirements for AMP applicants: At least 15 credits of undergraduate English courses at the 200 level or above, with an earned 3.5 GPA in these courses. Standard application requirements for the Master of Arts (M.A.) degree program, excluding GRE scores (i.e., undergraduate transcript(s), three letters of recommendation, statement of purpose, writing sample, and resume or cv). AMP applicants must complete the Accelerated Master's Program information along with their application for admission to the English M.A. degree program. Students admitted to the AMP program may apply a maximum of 12 credits of graduate-level course work toward completion of both the undergraduate and graduate degrees, provided that they earn a grade of B (3.0) or better in each graduate course and fulﬁll graduate- level requirements. Courses Up to, but not more than, 12 credits of graduate courses may be double- counted. For a course to apply toward both degrees, the student must earn a grade of B (3.0) or better in the course and fulﬁll graduate-level requirements. The M.A. degree requires 30-36 credit hours of graduate-level course work. If the maximum of 12 credits is double-counted toward both the undergraduate and graduate degrees, the student must complete a minimum of 18 credits of further graduate-level course work to complete the M.A. degree. No more than 9 credits at the 500 level may be counted toward the M.A. degree. Please see the University Catalog for a full description of the M.A. degree requirements. The following courses have been identiﬁed as those that may be counted toward the B.A. and M.A. degrees. These courses have been chosen because they are well suited to AMP students and because they are offered frequently enough to provide students substantial opportunity to enroll in them. All courses that lead to the completion of the M.A. degree must be approved by the Graduate Program Director. The following courses may be counted toward both the bachelor and master's degrees: Code Title Credit Hours ENG 549 The Critical Canon and Contemporary Issues 3 ENG 601 English Studies: Content, Methods, and Bibliography 3 ENG 642 Topics in Pre-1800 Literature * 3 ENG 664 Topics in Post-1800 Literature * 3 * May be repeated twice for credit when topic or instructor varies. Please consult with an advisor to determine how the courses taken at the graduate level will meet requirements in the bachelor's degree program.

UNC Greensboro 2023-24 University Catalog 353 Geography, Environment, and Sustainability College of Arts and Sciences 237 Graham Building 336-334-5388 http://ges.uncg.edu/ Dan Royall, Department Head Selima Sultana, Associate Department Head Jay Lennartson, Director of Undergraduate Studies Rick Bunch, Graduate Program Director Aaron S. Allen, Director of Environment and Sustainability Program Mission Statement The mission of the Department of Geography, Environment, and Sustainability is to advance understanding of the interconnected natural and human worlds through our interdisciplinary research, teaching, and service. GES is a student-centered department with a commitment to rigorous classroom instruction and providing opportunities for ﬁeld- based inquiry. Our faculty are leaders in their ﬁelds who translate their expertise into cutting-edge applied and theoretical teaching and research in our undergraduate, masters and doctoral programs. We prepare students for a wide range of careers and advanced research ﬁelds including sustainability, physical geography, urban planning, Geographic Information Science (GISc), and environmental ﬁelds. GES believes that our work can and should contribute to a more just, equitable, and sustainable world. We afﬁrm UNC Greensboro’s commitment to equal opportunity in education and employment for all persons and actively seek to increase representation from historically underrepresented groups. We acknowledge that ﬁelds of study represented in GES historically have struggled to attract students and faculty from diverse backgrounds and that the current makeup of GES does not mirror the diversity of UNC Greensboro. We therefore seek to create spaces that are welcoming of diversity in many forms, including race, religion, gender identity, sexual orientation, geographic origin, immigration status, socioeconomic background, political beliefs, veteran status, disability, family status, and age. About The Department of Geography, Environment, and Sustainability offers curricula with three principal objectives: to promote the understanding of the locational dimensions of human behavior in their environmental context; to offer courses of study through which concepts and methods are applied to understanding economic, environmental, and social problems at the local, regional, and global scales; and to promote sustainability through the interconnected lenses of social equity, the environment, economy, and aesthetics. Thus, the Department contributes an important dimension to the university student’s liberal education and provides practical training in important contemporary areas of concern as well as the background appropriate for certain vocations. Graduates of geography programs have found careers in business and industry, in urban and regional planning agencies, in departments of federal and state governments, and in teaching. Job titles include city or regional planner, cartographer, demographer, resource analyst, land or economic developer, location analyst, and teacher. Many graduates ﬁnd that an undergraduate degree in geography is an excellent foundation for advanced graduate work or professional training in planning, business, or law. Graduates of environmental and sustainability programs go on to careers in non-proﬁts, government, and the private sector as well as to graduate studies in a variety of disciplines. Career paths are numerous and include advocacy, agriculture, business, design, education, enforcement, journalism, law, nature and land protection, organizing for social and environmental justice, tourism and recreation, etc. Our students come from diverse backgrounds, participate regularly in internships and study abroad, and beneﬁt from personalized advising. Special facilities of the department include fully equipped laboratories in computer cartography, geographic information systems, remote sensing, and physical geography. The Department has led annual credit-bearing ﬁeld courses since the early 1980s. Graduate Programs The Department of Geography, Environment, and Sustainability offers a M.A. in Applied Geography, a M.S. in Environment and Sustainability, a Ph.D. in Geography, a Post-Baccalaureate Certiﬁcate in Climate Justice, a Post-Baccalaureate Certiﬁcate in Conservation, Post-Baccalaureate Certiﬁcate in Environmental Humanities, a Post-Baccalaureate Certiﬁcate in Global and Regional Studies Geography, and a Post-Baccalaureate Certiﬁcate in Sustainability. The department also offers a a Post- Baccalaureate Certiﬁcate in Urban and Economic Development jointly with the Department of Political Science; for more information, see the program page (p. 467). The programs focus on the application of theory and methods in geography toward the understanding of problems related to economic development, environmental quality, population change, and social well-being in urban, rural, regional, and international contexts. Environment and Sustainability Program Aaron S. Allen, Director and Honors Program Liaison The Environment & Sustainability Program is an interdisciplinary program that fosters understanding of the relationships between human societies and the natural, physical, and biological settings in which life on Earth exists. Our graduate degree (M.S.), two undergraduate majors (B.A.), and two minors all integrate perspectives of the natural sciences, social sciences, and arts and humanities. The program degrees build on the unique deﬁnition of sustainability at UNC Greensboro (http://sustainability.uncg.edu), where “Academics, operations, and outreach are conducted with careful attention to the enduring interconnectedness of social equity, the environment, the economy, and aesthetics.” Our degrees require electives in each of those four areas: natural sciences, equity and society, development and economics, and ethics and aesthetics. Students work with diverse faculty and staff from across campus and community (1) to learn how to gather and integrate information about environmental and sustainability problems from multiple disciplines, (2) to think critically about the causes of environmental and sustainability problems, (3) to propose effective solutions and evaluate their strengths and weaknesses, and (4) to communicate their ideas clearly. Our students come from a variety of backgrounds and are eligible for internships and study abroad, and all receive expert advising from program faculty. Graduates will be well prepared for roles as educated citizens who are especially well informed about the environment and for numerous career  354 Environment and Sustainability, B.A. paths that require a broad range of knowledge about environmental and sustainability issues.

The Department offers a broad spectrum of courses in U.S., European, and wider world history; in the ancient, medieval, and modern periods; in social, cultural, political, economic, intellectual, military, and diplomatic history; the history of science; and in a variety of special topics including gender, sexuality, witchcraft, and terrorism. The History Major prepares students for career opportunities in a wide range of employment, where liberally educated minds can be turned to fruitful account. It offers an excellent general background for later, more specialized studies in ﬁelds such as law and journalism. A number of history majors go on to work in public service at the local, state, and federal levels or ﬁnd employment in those areas of the private sector where a premium is put on a sound general education. Finally, many history majors employ their skills more directly: in the teaching profession (from the primary through graduate school levels), in museums and archives, or in the expanding ﬁeld of historical preservation work. The department offers programs leading to the Bachelor of Arts degree in history, a M.A. in History, a M.A. in History with a Museum Studies concentration, and a Ph.D. in history. The Public History Program (Museum Studies) works in partnership with the Department of Interior Architecture, cross-listing many core classes. Classes in each of our programs are generally small and, through an intensive mentoring program, faculty-student interaction has become a hallmark of graduate study in the department. Although the department does not formally restrict admission to its courses with regard to level, it recommends its 300-level courses to sophomores and above and its 400-level courses to juniors and seniors.

Students must pass a language examination or take an extra 3 credits of course work. Upon entering the program, students will develop an individualized plan of study with prior approval from the Graduate Program Director. They will develop three ﬁelds of study based upon the specializations of their three-member faculty committee. Any of our faculty members with graduate faculty status may serve as the main advisor for a M.A. committee. Such a framework allows our students maximum flexibility in pursuing research topics of greatest interest and applicability to their future goals. The M.A. in History offers excellent preparation for those planning to teach history at community colleges and secondary schools and provides a solid foundation for those who go on to Ph.D. programs or who ﬁnd employment in government and business. The M.A. improves analytic, research, and writing skills. The M.A. in History with a concentration in Museum Studies requires 36 credit hours. The program provides graduate-level preparation in the core history program and grounding in the theory and practice of public history. Through mentorship, signiﬁcant hands-on training, and an internship program, students are prepared to enter the professional world of public history in museums, historic sites, and other venues. For information regarding deadlines and requirements for admission, please see https://grs.uncg.edu/programs/. In addition to the application materials required by the Graduate School, applicants must submit: • Personal statement • Resume • Three letters of recommendation • 15-page writing sample Qualiﬁed applicants must present an approved undergraduate background (though not necessarily a major) in History. At least 9 credit hours of advanced undergraduate history is required. The submission of GRE scores is optional.

Chosen in consultation with their faculty committee members and the Graduate Program Director. One elective course (3 credits) may be taken at the graduate level in a related department or program, with the approval of the Graduate Program Director. Language Requirement Many areas of historical research require proﬁciency in a foreign language. Students who intend to concentrate in such areas are encouraged to pass the written language examination, administered by the department. In lieu of the language examination, students may substitute an extra 3-credit course. Students who intend to pursue a Ph.D., especially in areas other than U.S. history, are strongly encouraged to pass the language examination. Students may retake a failed language exam. Comprehensive Examination Students will develop three ﬁelds of study based upon the specializations of their three-member faculty committee. If a student selects a faculty member whose specialization is in U.S. history as main advisor, then at least one of the committee members must be a specialist in a non-U.S. ﬁeld. If a student selects a faculty member whose specialization is in European history as main advisor, then at least one of the committee members must be a specialist in a non-European ﬁeld. Similarly, if a student selects a faculty member whose specialization is outside United States or European history, at least one of the committee members must come from either U.S. or European history. Some faculty members may require that students have completed at least one course with them before agreeing to serve on a committee; students should consult with prospective committee members early in their graduate career. A faculty member from another UNC Greensboro department or program who has graduate faculty status can serve on a M.A. committee and create a ﬁeld of study. All students must pass a written comprehensive examination in each of their three ﬁelds of study. The exams are usually administered twice a year, during Fall and Spring. Students may retake a failed comprehensive exam once. Research Seminars Capstone Experience Students may take HIS 703 M.A. Research Project I/HIS 704 M.A. Research Project II or have the option of completing a 6-credit thesis (HIS 699 Thesis), with the approval of the main faculty advisor and the Graduate Program Director.

Students are required to integrate the major ﬁeld with two minor ﬁelds, designed to add temporal, methodological, or geographical diversity to the major ﬁeld. This broader intercontinental perspective enables students to explore themes such as the interaction of political, economic, and cultural systems, questions of race and ethnicity, and the transnational dimensions of national experience. This global perspective is encouraged by providing a selection of courses that are cross-national, comparative, and integrative in content and format. Students are encouraged to enlarge their perspective by understanding and analyzing national history in broader, international contexts. This goal is facilitated in two ways: ﬁrst, a close integration of the minors into the major area; second, a selection of courses that are cross-national and integrative in format. In a setting of relatively small classes, individualized research projects, and frequent contact with faculty, students are trained in the arts of scholarly research and writing. No less is the emphasis placed on fostering teaching skills. Through a required teaching seminar, hands- on teaching experience, and careful mentoring, students are prepared for teaching in a college or university environment. A total of 48-84 credit hours of course work and dissertation credit, including a minimum of 36-54 credits of course work beyond the M.A. in history and a minimum of 12 credits of dissertation credit, are required to complete the Ph.D. in history. Upon entering the program, all students will develop a Plan of Study with the approval of the Graduate Program Director. For information regarding deadlines and requirements for admission, please see https://grs.uncg.edu/programs/. In addition to the application materials required by the Graduate School, applicants must submit a writing sample and a personal statement to be considered for admission. The submission of GRE scores is optional. The Ph.D. program admits only a few highly-qualiﬁed students each year. To enroll in the program, students must ﬁrst obtain a M.A. in History, as well as a B.A. in History or a closely-related ﬁeld.

As a discipline, Interior Architecture interweaves the arts and the sciences, discipline, both mutually informing and connecting with the allied disciplines of interior design, architecture, art, historic preservation, engineering, and graphic, industrial, and product design. Undergraduate The Interior Architecture program is structured as a continuing sequence of studio courses that help the student develop a deepening mastery of the processes of designing architectural interiors. The ﬁrst year presents small-scale problems that take the student through the total design process, from problem identiﬁcation to graphic communication of the solution. Methods of drawing, making, and craft are emphasized. Second- year design studios focus on the development of interior design skills such as space planning, the satisfaction of human needs, and attention to function within the context of interior spaces. Visual communication skills are stressed. Third- and fourth-year studio courses engage students with typical interior environments, with emphasis on institutional and commercial interiors, but also including residential design, historic restoration, adaptive reuse, and interior product design. The curriculum is highly sequenced, requiring students to successfully complete courses at one level before progressing to the next. Attention is also directed toward the environmental needs of special populations. The Interior Architecture Internship provides opportunities for experiential learning in design practice through private design ﬁrms, government agencies, or health care facilities. Accreditation The Interior Architecture program is accredited by the Council for Interior Design Accreditation (CIDA). Departmental Admission Entry into the Interior Architecture program requires a secondary application at https://apply.uncg.edu/apply/? sr=2c690277-620b-4cd1-81e3-2f29b2fecf21. Enrollment is limited. Students are admitted on evidence of scholastic and design potential, motivation, and self-direction. A personal interview or group orientation during a scheduled Open House is highly recommended. Students may not enroll in interior architecture courses without formal admission to the Interior Architecture program or written permission from the instructor. Students accepted as Pre-Interior Architecture majors by the university must also complete the secondary application to gain acceptance into the program and complete the BFA degree sequence. Transfer students must also complete the secondary application at https://apply.uncg.edu/apply/? sr=2c690277-620b-4cd1-81e3-2f29b2fecf21. Additionally, they must submit a portfolio and transcript evidence of art and design skills acquired through prior course work if they wish to be considered for advanced placement in the program. Only students who have previously taken art, architecture, design, or interior design courses can be considered for advanced placement. Graduate The Master of Fine Arts (M.F.A.) in Interior Architecture offers students a venue for advanced investigations of the built environment in close collaboration with faculty mentors. Students pursuing an M.F.A. in Interior Architecture develop their own intellectual interests in design while preparing for careers in teaching, research, or specialized practice. The program offers distinctly strong student-faculty relationships, where students work closely with faculty members to gain expertise. The Department of Interior Architecture supports a broad range of student interests reflecting IARc’s values of promoting sustainable design for social, psychological, and ecological well-being. The department offers particular strengths in historic preservation, interior product design, community-engaged design, and human-environment relationships.

We afford students experiences that highlight oral and written literacy, literary analysis, critical skills, and cultural and aesthetic appreciation through instruction in literature, culture, and linguistics in various languages, including American Sign Language, Arabic, Chinese, French, German, Japanese, Korean, Russian, and Spanish. Through engaged teaching, innovative research, diverse creative activity, and dedicated service, the Department strives to: • Communicate an understanding of languages, literatures, and cultures within the context of a humanistic liberal education; • Connect with individuals and communities within the department, across the campus, the state, the nation, and the world to foster a culture of meaningful intellectual inquiry, participatory and life-long learning that promotes respect for all; • Contribute to the University's strategic goal of internationalizing the campus as we prepare our students to excel in a variety of professions and graduate studies. Programs The Department offers the programs listed below. • Languages, Literatures, and Cultures major with the following concentrations: • Applied Languages: French K–12 Teaching Licensure • Applied Languages: Spanish K–12 Teaching Licensure • French and Francophone Studies • German Studies • Global Languages and Communities • Spanish Major • Minors: American Sign Language, Chinese, French, German, Russian, and Spanish • The Department also offers a sequence of courses in Arabic, Japanese, and Korean. The Department contributes to various concentrations in the International and Global Studies program and the major in International Business Studies. We take very seriously our role in preparing students to apply their liberal arts education to future careers in areas such as education, business, health professions, and public service. We also offer Master of Arts and Master of Education degrees with concentrations in French and Spanish and a Post-Baccalaureate Certiﬁcate in Advanced Spanish Language and Hispanic Cultural Studies to provide further scholarly and professional training. Through its courses, degree programs, and co-curricular activities, the Department contributes to the university’s goal of promoting diversity and internationalizing the curriculum. We foster students’ abilities to communicate within a global context and to reflect on their own heritage by supporting exchange and study abroad programs. The Department is also committed to promoting an atmosphere in which creativity and scholarly accomplishment may flourish for both students and faculty. Through our engaged teaching, innovative research and creative activity, and dedicated service, the faculty works to improve pedagogy, scholarship, and the community. The Department promotes co-curricular activities through language clubs, honorary societies, ﬁlm series, and other opportunities. Paid or unpaid internships requiring foreign language skills are increasingly available. Students may elect to live in the Global Village or UNC Greensboro’s International House and are encouraged to participate in study abroad opportunities through UNC Greensboro’s International Programs Center or through Summer Study Abroad sponsored by the Department. German Studies and Russian Studies Consortia offer a broad array of German and Russian courses in language, literature, and culture taught by specialists in the UNC system through the N.C. Information Superhighway. Students with special learning needs may qualify for the Modiﬁed Foreign Language Program in Spanish. Registration in the program requires written permission from the Department. Native or near-native speakers must consult with an appropriate departmental advisor before signing up for courses in the Department of Languages, Literatures, and Cultures. Students with one or more years of Chinese or Japanese must contact the course instructor or a departmental advisor before registering for courses. Intermediate proﬁciency (equivalent to 204 or 241 level) is expected for major-level work in French, German, or Spanish. Students cannot receive credit for lower-level courses after taking and receiving credit for higher level ones. Language Placement Test in French, German, Russian, or Spanish Students with one or more years of high school French, German, Russian, or Spanish who wish to continue the study of that same language at UNC Greensboro must take the Language Placement Test. Incoming transfer students returning to the study of French, German, Russian, or Spanish begun in high school but not previously pursued at the college level, must also take the test. Transfer students with college- level foreign languages credit are encouraged to take the placement test to determine their best starting point. The Language Placement Test is administered at SOAR orientation sessions during the summer and before the beginning of each semester. The test may also be taken during the year on an individual basis,  394 Languages, Literatures, and Cultures, B.A. by appointment, in the Department’s ofﬁce. Students should call the Department at 336-334-5655 to schedule their appointment. Language Placement Test scores are valid for one year after the test is taken. The test can be taken only once a year. Once a student has begun the lower-level sequence (101–204/241), she or he cannot retake the placement test in order to place out of any of the remaining courses in the sequence. A student who scores at the interview-stage level and is planning to continue in the language at the 300 level should consult the Director of Undergraduate Study for the appropriate language or another designated faculty member before registering for any other course in the language. The advisor will interview the student in order to determine his or her placement at the 300 level or recommend courses at the intermediate level to reinforce the student’s background in language. If a student who scores at the interview-stage level does not plan to continue study in the language, the Department of Languages, Literatures, and Cultures will conﬁrm the student’s Language Placement Test scores with the University Registrar’s Ofﬁce, and the student will be considered as having met the foreign language requirement at UNC Greensboro. Students in need of additional advising or with concerns regarding the placement results are asked to make an appointment with a designated faculty member. Graduate Studies The Department of Languages, Literatures, and Cultures, as part of its commitment to further the study of foreign languages and literatures both regionally and nationally, offers the Master of Arts (M.A.) in Languages, Literatures, and Cultures with a concentration in French and Francophone Studies or Spanish. Students may choose from a broad spectrum of courses and possibilities, whether they are interested in perfecting their knowledge of French or Spanish or pursuing doctoral studies. Each program is balanced and comprehensive while allowing for electives in French, Spanish, or a related ﬁeld. A Masters of Arts in Teaching (M.A.T.) and a Masters of Education (M.Ed.) in Teacher Education with a concentration in French Education or Spanish Education are also offered. Most graduate classes are offered in the late afternoon, evening, or online to accommodate working professionals.

The program is designed to provide students with an opportunity to earn their baccalaureate degree online by gaining a thorough understanding of the humanities, the interconnections among them, and their relevance to individuals and to modern society. The humanities are broadly deﬁned to include those disciplines that study people—their ideas, their history, their literature, their artifacts, and their values. The program will investigate individual people in their solitude, life together in societies, and models of and for reality that constitute cultures. Individual courses will tackle the Big Questions that have been the traditional province of the humanities such as “What makes a life worth living?” Upon completion of the Liberal and Interdisciplinary Studies Humanities Concentration students will be able to: • Think critically and analytically. • Communicate clearly and effectively. • Understand and explain interconnections among the Humanities disciplines. • Appreciate the wide range of human experience. • Achieve increased depth of knowledge in one of the four categories of the Humanities: Literature, Fine Arts, Philosophy/Religion/Ethics, Historical Perspectives. Professional Studies The Liberal and Interdisciplinary Studies, Professional Studies concentration, is an interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary online program. The program is designed to provide students with an opportunity to earn their baccalaureate degree online by combining course work from the humanities, social sciences, and other ﬁelds in a curriculum that emphasizes the skills and knowledge that will be helpful in the workplace. Upon completing the Liberal and Interdisciplinary Studies Professional Studies Concentration students will be able to: • Communicate clearly and effectively in an appropriate professional style. • Read texts with careful attention. • Think critically and analytically. • Connect learning in the humanities, social sciences, and other ﬁelds to their professional lives. Social Sciences The Liberal and Interdisciplinary Studies, Social Sciences Concentration, is an interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary online program. The program is designed to provide students with an opportunity to earn their baccalaureate degree online by gaining a broad-based understanding of the social sciences. The social sciences are the ﬁelds of academic scholarship that explore aspects of human behavior and societies. Upon completing the Liberal and Interdisciplinary Studies Social Sciences concentration students will be able to: • Engage theory and practice in the social sciences to better understand human behavior, activities, organizations, and cultures. • Critically analyze social science related information in the popular media. • Explain the interconnections, differences, and interdependence among the social sciences. • Read, evaluate, and interpret research in the social sciences. • Communicate clearly and effectively in an appropriate professional style. General Psychology The Liberal and Interdisciplinary Studies, General Psychology concentration, creates an opportunity path for students interested in human services careers, which require psychological knowledge but not necessarily all the speciﬁc technical “know-how” of a Psychology BA or BS. UNCG has many students who graduate every year and work in the ﬁeld broadly described as “human services” that include everything from activities coordinators at nursing homes to case managers in the juvenile justice system. These students are often interested in psychology and require knowledge about human behavior and cognition but will not be working in the therapeutic or research settings that a Psychology BA or BS prepares them for. The BLS General Psychology concentration allows these students to tailor psychology class selections to the settings they plan on working in, with a broader research methods class that provides preparation applicable in most workplaces (survey and observational research, rather than laboratory experiments). The BLS General Psychology concentration also requires a capstone experience designed to reinforce the knowledge students have gained from an interdisciplinary point of view, preparing them for their careers of interest. Upon completion of the Liberal and Interdisciplinary Studies General Psychology Concentration students will be able to: • Communicate clearly and effectively in an appropriate professional style. • Connect learning in the humanities, social sciences, and other ﬁelds to their professional lives, emphasizing current research in the ﬁeld of psychology. • Think critically and analytically about behavior and mental processes. • Understand and explain interconnections between psychology and other ﬁelds. The Bachelor of Arts in Liberal Studies Program offers the following concentrations in the Liberal and Interdisciplinary Studies Major: • Humanities • Professional Studies • Social Sciences • General Psychology All four concentrations are offered in an online format. The following modiﬁcation of the CIC requirements apply to students in the Bachelor of Arts in Liberal Studies program: 1. Students who transfer in 60+ credit hours and do not have 101 and 102 of an additional language can complete 6 credit hours (or 3 credit hours if they have 101 credit) of MAC Global Engagement and Intercultural Learning (C9) courses to satisfy the additional language requirement.  UNC Greensboro 2023-24 University Catalog 415 2. The breadth of knowledge requirement and the additional language requirement are waived for reactivated students and students who change their major from outside of CAS with 90 or more credits. Students in the BLS Program who have previously completed a foreign language through the 102 level, with a subsequent learning gap of ﬁve years or more, may apply to the program for permission to use culture- track courses in English (from a list pre-approved by the College Appeals Committee) as substitutions for the intermediate-level 203 and 204 language classes. See the Liberal and Interdisciplinary Studies Major (p. 417) for requirements. Integrated Professional Studies 1100 West Market St., Rm. 308 336-315-7792 Muktha Jost, Executive Director, Liberal and Professional Studies Angi Kinsey, Professional Studies Advisor and winner of 2023 Advising Award (College of Arts and Sciences) Program Faculty David Bull, Lecturer Sarah Dunning, Lecturer Afﬁliated Faculty Alan Benson, Megan Cayton, Amy Ernstes, Laura Field, Robbie Furter, Angela Kinsey, Carrie Levesque, Melissa Roberts, Joseph Ross, Megan Rudock, Jeffrey Sarbaum, Jenni Simon, John Stinnett, Frannie Varker, Mike Watson Overview Take your career to the next level with a degree that makes you stand out. Develop the expertise you need and the skills employers want as you learn to see and think from different perspectives. Earn your B.S. in Professional Studies online at UNCG to: • Master critical thinking and problem solving skills in fully online courses. • Practice skills with real-world projects, not endless exams. • Develop depth of interest and breadth of perspective that employers want. • Chart a clear path to graduation with a team that supports you. Career Preparation Research shows that employers are looking for professionals with a T shape–having the depth in an area of interest and the breadth to see and think from different perspectives. Employers say these skills are lacking in today’s graduates, so the Professional Studies program was designed to develop them. Students build on existing knowledge in a ﬁeld while gaining skills that apply to any workplace and any role. The Professional Studies program offers multiple entry points for new freshman, transfer students as well as change of major students. The core courses in the program contribute to a breadth of knowledge while the courses in a selected ‘area of focus’ offer the depth of knowledge in a discipline. Six core courses build on each other and help identify patterns, interpret data, work collaboratively to solve problems, and make informed decisions. The Capstone at the end of the program provides students with an opportunity to apply and demonstrate their learning by creating an electronic portfolio. The Professional Studies Difference The program was designed to meet the needs of all students—from the job seeker to the working professional. All Professional Studies courses are seven weeks long, and offered online. Also, there are no set class times. There will be set due dates for assignments and projects, but otherwise the program offers the flexibility for students to pursue their degree without class meetings. At the same time, instructors use a variety of tools to personalize the online classroom. The Bachelor's in Professional Studies is intentionally structured to challenge students to think and learn in new ways, and real-world projects and case studies form the foundation for learning. The focus is on thinking critically, interpreting data, and solving problems, all of which can be used immediately in the workplace. In addition, students receive customized support designed on the basis of career goals, interests, and transfer credits that creates a clear path to graduation. Course Highlights Design and Systems Thinking (IPS 300) How do thoughts, perspectives, models, patterns, and perceptions impact the world? That will be the focus of this course, as you apply systems- thinking tools to case studies and a real-world example of your own choosing. Global Awareness and Intercultural Competence (IPS 305) In today’s workplace, cultural competence and empathy are more important than ever. Increase your global awareness and learn how to use empathy effectively when working with other cultures.

Our interdisciplinary, liberal  416 Liberal and Professional Studies arts approach emphasizes intercultural competency, strong foreign language proﬁciency, and a critical understanding of the complexity and interconnectedness of world regions and populations. Study Abroad and other cross-cultural experiences are also integral components of the Program. We therefore prepare our students for a variety of public- and private-sector careers where these qualities and experiences are valued, as well as for graduate and professional studies in ﬁelds with an international or global focus. Liberal and Interdisciplinary Studies Major Concentrations in the International and Global Studies Program Concentration areas afford intellectual and curricular deﬁnition to each student’s course of study. Majors, second majors, and minors should select the concentration area that best complements their interests. Functional Studies • International and Global Affairs and Development (major concentration) A study of the political, sociological, economic, environmental, and health-related issues and the interdependence among peoples, governments, and nations of the world. • International and Global Arts and Belief Systems (major concentration) A study of the arts, literatures, philosophies, and belief systems unique to and interconnecting other nations and peoples of the world. • International and Global Human Rights (major concentration) A study of the foundations of freedom, justice, and peace as they relate to the protection of the dignity and rights of human beings around the world. Regional Studies • Asian Studies (major concentration or minor) • Latin American and Caribbean Studies (major concentration or minor) • Russian Studies (major concentration or minor) • African Studies (minor) • European Studies (minor) International/Global Experience (IGE) By the end of their ﬁnal semester of study, all IGS majors must have completed an approved “international” or “global” experience. This requirement will be met by completing a qualiﬁed study-abroad experience that satisﬁes the requirements listed below. A Qualiﬁed Study-Abroad Experience Study abroad affords the greatest opportunity for total immersion in another socio-political, economic, and cultural context, thus enhancing knowledge, skills, and dispositions central to the major. In addition, course work completed during study abroad typically has application toward the major’s curricular requirements (especially IGS’s foreign language and/or Additional Course requirements). The characteristics listed below shall distinguish such an experience as “qualiﬁed”. • Any semester- or year-long study abroad experience with exchange partners arranged through UNC Greensboro’s International Programs Center (IPC). • A short-term or summer study-abroad program approved by IPC or the IGS Director and equivalent to at least 6 credits of academic credit. Note: whenever possible, students should select a study abroad site that affords an immersion experience for the foreign language they are studying to meet the IGS FL requirement. Conﬁrmation of completion of this requirement will be documented on the IGS Degree Audit following review of the student’s UNC Greensboro transcript or UNC Greensboro degree evaluation. This audit will be submitted to the University Registrar’s Ofﬁce at the end of the major’s program of study. Study Abroad Alternative In circumstances where study abroad is unfeasible (e.g., in cases of serious ﬁnancial or personal hardship) or redundant (e.g., in cases of international students), a major must submit a “Study Abroad Alternative” request to the IGS director, who will assess the validity of the case. Should the study abroad obligation be waived, the IGE requirement should be met by completing the UNC Greensboro Global Leadership Program (GLP) by the student’s ﬁnal semester of study. The GLP offers students who are interested in international and global societies and issues an opportunity to hone the range of skills necessary to develop as global leaders. Through a combination of experiences involving work with immigrants and refugees in the local community and/or foreign students on campus, GLP participants will prepare themselves to become engaged world citizens with an appreciation of the importance of intercultural understanding. Additional alternatives may be available. Contact the IGS director for details.

UNC Greensboro 2023-24 University Catalog 437 Liberal and Interdisciplinary Studies, M.A. 1100 West Market St., Rm. 308 336-315-7792 Muktha Jost, Executive Director, Liberal and Professional Studies Paige Turner, Program Advisor The M.A. in Liberal and Interdisciplinary Studies program provides students and working professionals a unique mix of knowledge, tools, and experience that are relevant to the current world and its complexity. Program readings and assignments encourage students to think creatively, question assumptions, and imagine solutions to real-world problems thus creating a pathway to transformative thinking. Transformative Thinking Students bring their unique skills, knowledge and values to the program and work towards connecting the dots between big ideas, historic movements, and global events. The program helps students gain mastery in the following ﬁve attributes to become a transformative thinker and doer: 1. Intellectual curiosity (develop the desire to dig deep, be creative, experiment, and take risks in order to learn); 2. Integrative thinking (see the big picture, think holistically, recognize patterns, and make imaginative leaps based on those patterns); 3. Intercultural competence (understand cultural differences to help one think, act, and move beyond global, cultural, and organizational boundaries); 4. Adaptability (be flexible, agile when handling change, resilient in ambiguous situations, and able to ﬁnd unexpected solutions); and 5. Empathy (demonstrate effective listening, collaboration, and communication skills and be humble enough to be inclusive and considerate of the views of others). Program Format All M.A. in Liberal and Interdisciplinary Studies courses (10) are seven weeks long, asynchronous (no set class times), and offered online. There will be set due dates for assignments and projects, but otherwise the program offers the flexibility for students to pursue their degree without synchronous class meetings. At the same time, instructors use a variety of tools to personalize the online classroom. The Capstone course follows four core courses and ﬁve electives and provides the opportunity to students to synthesize and apply their learning to a project of their choosing, such as a current challenge in their workplace or community.

Philosophy courses fall into natural groups. See Philosophy Course Groups as listed in the Philosophy Major. Groups A and B are useful preparation for careers in law and government, and the department offers a major in philosophy with a Prelaw concentration. Group B provides knowledge and skills vital to careers in science and medicine. Group C relates philosophy to other humanistic disciplines and is vital to a liberal education. Group D is necessary for advanced work in philosophy. All courses under 300 and many higher level courses are open to for courses may be waived at the discretion of the instructor. Students are encouraged to begin work in Philosophy by taking PHI 111, PHI 115, PHI 119, PHI 341, PHI 342, or PHI 310. The department sponsors The Great Conversation, a series of talks by UNC Greensboro Philosophy faculty and other distinguished scholars. Lectures by philosophers from other institutions are also offered. There is an informal philosophy club that is open to all undergraduates, regardless of major. The department also holds a biannual symposium on a topic of current research in philosophy (when the budget allows). We are now able to offer ﬁnancial assistance to Philosophy majors planning to study abroad through our Wyatt Lee Martin Memorial Fund. Please contact the Department for information about this opportunity. There is a chapter of the national philosophy honor society, Phi Sigma Tau, at UNC Greensboro. Qualiﬁed students are invited to join this chapter. Each March the department considers submissions from undergraduates for the Roger Schwirck Award for Excellence in Philosophy.

Does God exist? What actions are morally good? Philosophy majors produce answers to these questions based not on dogma, but on careful rational argument. This focus on reason and argumentation guarantees that students develop improved analytical skills, and this explains why undergraduate philosophy majors consistently score the highest on graduate school standardized tests, such as the LSAT and GRE. The Prelaw concentration provides a strong preparation for law school through courses in logic, epistemology, ethics, political philosophy, and the philosophy of law. These courses cover a broad range of skills and knowledge that are of fundamental importance in the ﬁeld of law.

The undergraduate major program seeks to provide the student with a broad and general background in all areas of physics. With this background, the student should be able to adapt readily to the specialized requirements of a job in industry or pursue graduate study in physics, engineering, and other related ﬁelds. The faculty members are involved with students in research in observational astrophysics and spectroscopic analysis, computer simulation and computational physics, biophysics, and nuclear physics. The department manages the Three College Observatory, located in a nearby dark-sky location. This observatory contains a large (32 inch) reflecting telescope, along with a low light-level image acquisition system and a high resolution spectrograph. The effort required for a non-scientist to understand our technological society is formidable, but essential if an educated person is to intelligently understand and affect our natural surroundings. Recognizing this, the Department of Physics and Astronomy offers for the non-major, with no prerequisites, courses with overviews of physics and astronomy.

It studies the political behavior, attitudes, and ideas of groups and individuals. All 100- and 200-level courses are introductions to the study of political science. Beginning students are urged to take any 100- or 200-level course in which they may be interested. Students seeking electives in political science may select from almost the entire range of offerings. Non-majors are urged to select their electives widely to satisfy individual intellectual interests and are not restricted to 100- and 200-level courses. Internships and ﬁeld experiences are available to both majors and non- majors in national government, nonproﬁt agencies, public administration, and electoral politics. Professor Hunter Bacot Bill E.

We offer broad training in psychology that can prepare students for the working world and graduate training in most major branches of psychology. We offer specialized training in the major areas of psychology, including clinical psychology, cognitive psychology, cultural psychology, social psychology, personality psychology, developmental psychology, biological psychology, and quantitative and research skills. At both the undergraduate and graduate levels, the major objectives of the curriculum include: 1. To provide an understanding of the use of scientiﬁc methodology in psychological research at both intermediate and advanced levels. This understanding will include a familiarity with the design of observational, survey, and experimental studies; principles of inference from scientiﬁc data; the logic of statistical testing; and the scientiﬁc literature. 2. To provide knowledge in primary areas of the discipline and how they interconnect to explain behavior through an array of required intermediate-level core courses. 3. To develop depth of understanding in areas of the discipline speciﬁc to students’ individual interests. 4. To ensure that students can write clearly and effectively in an appropriate professional style. 5. To provide the combination of a sound scholarly foundation with methodological and practical skills that will enable the student to function in a variety of academic, research, and service settings. Teacher Licensure Undergraduate students who wish to seek teacher licensure should see School of Education Initial Licensure Programs (p. 653) as well as below. Such persons should contact the departmental Undergraduate Program Director as early as possible. Graduate Training Programs The Psychology Department offers two graduate training tracks— a terminal M.A. in general experimental psychology and a Ph.D. in psychology with specializations in clinical and experimental (e.g., cognitive, developmental, and social) psychology. Students may apply to either or both tracks. The M.A. degree is earned as part of the doctoral programs. The clinical program has been continuously accredited by the American Psychological Association since its initial accreditation in 1982. The next site visit is in 2023. The goal of the terminal M.A. program is the conferral of the Master of Arts degree. Those who successfully complete the terminal M.A., however, may apply to the Ph.D. program. In addition, students with master’s degrees from other institutions are welcome to apply to the Ph.D. program. The Psychology Department has additional policies and procedures that are described in the Psychology Graduate Student Handbooks, which are accessible from the Graduate Program Overview (https://psy.uncg.edu/ graduate/graduate-overview/) page. The graduate program has four major areas of concentration: • Clinical (Eddington, Fields-Olivieri, Jensen, Keane, Mendez Smith, Nelson-Gray, Stein, Vrshek-Schallhorn, and Wisco)—includes research training and clinical training in a variety of service settings. • Cognitive (Delaney, Kane, Marcovitch, Touron, Wahlheim, and Wiley)— includes basic research in human memory, attention, cognition, and language. • Developmental (Boseovski, DeJesus, Keane, Marcovitch, Touron, and Wahlheim)—includes basic research in behavioral, cognitive, language, and social development in infant, child, adolescent, and adult humans and in animals. • Social (Baker, Boseovski, Cassidy, Silvia, and Zell)—includes basic research in social phenomena, e.g., aggression, attitudes, communication, gender relations, intergroup comparison, and social competence.

If only 3 credits of quantitative course work are taken (from the list of courses provided in the catalog for this requirement or a comparable course approved by the planning committee), then the student must also take 3 credits of PSY 735C, PSY 735D, PSY 735I, PSY 735J, or PSY 735S covering a contemporary issue in the discipline of Psychology (i.e. covering Discipline-Speciﬁc Knowledge) or the integration of two or more areas within Psychology or a seminar outside the department approved by the committee. If 6 credits of quantitative course work are taken, then the requirement is satisﬁed.  476 Psychology, Ph.D. 3 4 credits minimum must be completed in addition to the M.A. requirement, 1 credit in each of four semesters. 4 In addition to the credits earned for the M.A. 5 1 credit in each of two semesters. Discipline Speciﬁc Knowledge (Basic and Advanced integrative) Coverage of basic knowledge in ﬁve core areas of Psychology (Biological, Developmental, Social, Cognitive, and Affective) and advanced integration of this knowledge across at least two of these areas is evaluated and met through a variety of ways including: 1) formal graduate level course work which builds on a student’s pre-matriculation experiences and competencies, 2) laboratory based research, including the thesis and dissertation, and 3) preliminary examination paper and oral defense. In some cases, pre-matriculation competencies may fulﬁll the basic foundational requirement for one or more areas. Regardless of the speciﬁc way in which a student meets these requirements outside of formal course work, a minimum of two graduate-level courses are required to complete this requirement. Students select from a menu of courses, based on their pre-matriculation experiences and in consultation with the planning committee. At least two courses, each incorporating at least two of the basic core areas and including integration across the area, are required. In choosing from an array of courses, coverage of at least four different core areas must be attained. Students will obtain foundational coverage in the ﬁfth basic area through other educational means (e.g., thesis prelim or dissertation, pre-matriculation competencies with graduate-level evaluation, etc.). Regardless of means of acquiring advanced integrative knowledge, all educational experiences are evaluated at the graduate level. Speciﬁc courses fulﬁlling this requirement are individually planned for each student in consultation with the doctoral planning committee and are determined in part by the student’s pre-matriculation competencies and research and career goals. Additional Quantitative Course/Seminar Requirement for the Ph.D. Degree Note that a minimum of 3 credits must be in the Quantitative area. If 6 credits are taken in Quantitative, no additional seminar is required. If only 3 credits are taken in the Quantitative area, the student must supplement their course work with an additional seminar (PSY 735C, PSY 735D, PSY 735I, PSY 735J, or PSY 735S) course either in clinical or within another area(s) of Psychology, or an outside seminar approved by the doctoral planning committee).

Cureton, Department Head Trevor Hoppe, Director of Undergraduate Studies Cindy Brooks Dollar, Graduate Program Director Mission Statement The Department of Sociology supports the missions of the College of Arts and Sciences and the university in three areas: education, research and service. The Department fosters a community of sociologists, mentors students of sociology at the undergraduate and graduate levels, and provides general education for students throughout the university. Sociological knowledge helps students to understand how social structures and processes shape social life and how sociological analysis and empirical research are used as tools of understanding. The Department also encourages the research and professional development of faculty, contributes knowledge to the community of scholars and to the larger society, and provides service to the discipline, college, university, and extramural communities. About The undergraduate program in sociology is planned primarily as a part of a liberal arts education. The objective is to provide the student with an analytic and systematic approach to the understanding of social relations. The major provides a foundation for a variety of occupations and for advanced study. Graduate study leading to the Master of Arts degree with a major in Sociology also is available.

In order to gain a larger intellectual perspective, students are encouraged to pursue their major ﬁeld of study within an open but disciplined plan of study. To aid in this process, the CVPA minor requirement builds on the university's General Education Program - Minerva's Academic Curriculum (MAC). In addition to the course requirements stated in MAC, students pursuing a B.A. degree in the College of Visual and Performing Arts must also complete all requirements in a minor area of study that is different from their declared major ﬁeld. Students may select minors in or outside of the College of Visual and Performing Arts, and students are encouraged to seek advice from CVPA advisors when making this choice. Any B.A. student who is pursuing a double major or seeking K–12 licensure in conjunction with his or her major area is exempt from this requirement.

UNCG is an accredited institutional member of the National Association of Schools of Art and Design (NASAD) Only those students enrolled in a degree program with a full-time load of courses may use space, equipment, and facilities of the School of Art. Part-time students may use only the facilities directly connected with the courses in which they are enrolled. Mission Statement The mission of the School of Art is founded on three passionately held principles: • First, that the exploration of ideas through the visual arts is both necessary and culturally valuable; • Second, that an understanding of visual communication within contemporary society is critical for an informed world view; and • Third, that an appreciation and knowledge of art history, past and present, is essential to both young scholars and developing artists. In the School of Art, committed faculty, who actively exhibit and publish nationally and internationally, model the high standards we hold our students to in the visual arts, art history, and art education. Our students individually challenge, explore, and push the boundaries of their given ﬁeld, whether it be establishing an independent vision or perspective in the studio, exploring new facets of art history, or developing their own voices as art educators. Through this diversity, our program offers students a strong, self-motivated course of study where majors have meaningful contact with faculty across disciplines, methodologies, and practices. The school’s studio and art education facilities are located in the Maud F. Gatewood Studio Arts Building on Highland Avenue. Art historians have ofﬁces located in the Weatherspoon Art Museum.

In addition, the application to candidacy must be approved by a committee of the Art Department graduate faculty to be appointed by the Department Head. The committee will meet with students to review work and sign candidacy forms early in the fall semester of the second year of graduate work. Students are limited to two candidacy reviews. If a student is not admitted to candidacy during the ﬁrst review, the review team will issue written recommendations for further studies. The second review will take place within a year of the ﬁrst. Failure to pass candidacy for the second time will prohibit the student from continuing in the program. Oral Thesis Presentation In the Spring semester of the graduating year, each M.F.A. candidate will give a formal oral presentation to their thesis committee concurrent with the installation of their thesis exhibition. After passing candidacy review in the Fall semester of the ﬁnal year, the student and the Thesis Chair consult together to name the remaining members of the committee. The Department Head and the Graduate Program Director review the membership of the committee before the student begins thesis work. The committee consists of four to ﬁve faculty members who hold graduate faculty status in the University. Part-time faculty do not serve on thesis committees. At least one member of the committee is a studio faculty member who teaches in the same discipline as the student’s studio practice. One other member is an art historian, art educator, or member of the Weatherspoon Museum graduate faculty. It is optional for the student to select a graduate faculty member from another department in the university. This faculty member should pursue scholarly research that relates to the student’s ﬁeld of interest. Thesis Chairs are selected from the studio art or art history faculty. Early in the ﬁnal semester of thesis work, the student arranges a meeting with the thesis committee to discuss all aspects of ﬁnal thesis work, including the thesis paper, the oral presentation, the comprehensive art history exam, and the thesis exhibition. The thesis paper should be 5-10 pages in length, conform to Graduate School requirements, and be signed by all committee members before it is electronically submitted to The Graduate School. The body of work submitted for the thesis exhibition must receive ﬁnal approval of all thesis committee members.  508 School of Dance School of Dance College of Visual and Performing Arts 323 Coleman Building 336-334-5570 http://dance.uncg.edu (http://performingarts.uncg.edu) Lee Walton, Director of Dance Ana Paula Höfling, Graduate Program Director Clarice Young, Director of Undergraduate Studies Mila Parrish, Director of Dance Education Janet Lilly, Dance Minor Advisor Mission Statement Within the context of UNC Greensboro’s comprehensive liberal arts curriculum, the School of Dance offers bachelors and masters degrees that provide specialized skills for a variety of careers in the evolving ﬁeld of dance.

Students regularly attend and perform in concerts by the Greensboro Symphony Orchestra, the Greensboro Opera Company, the Winston-Salem Symphony and the Eastern Music Festival along with a myriad of musical theatre, jazz, and chamber music ensembles. We welcome students who will strive for excellence and will contribute to the inclusiveness and diversity of our mission. Mission Statement We approach music as an essential part of human culture and therefore aspire to engage with the diversity of musical meanings and practices globally and locally; our student and faculty scholarship enrich understandings of music as sound, text, and activity. We engage with local, regional, national and international communities through teaching, performance, publications, lectures, conferences, symposia, festivals, and other educational and cultural programs. Undergraduate Programs The B.A. in music provides high-quality musical training with the versatility and breadth of a liberal arts education, it prepares students for a variety of careers and opportunities. With its emphasis on writing, speaking, and critical thinking skills, the B.A. degree is ideal for students wishing to pursue a double major in another academic ﬁeld, pre-professional programs in law or medicine, study abroad, UNC Greensboro in 3, arts administration, or graduate programs in music theory, musicology, or ethnomusicology. Undergraduate students in Music Performance pursue rigorous professional training in music along with a broad liberal arts education. Our students graduate as informed, responsible citizens with the tools to succeed and communicate effectively as musicians of the 21st century. Undergraduate students in Music Education pursue rigorous professional training in music teacher education along with a broad liberal arts education that prepares them for positions as choral directors (principal performance area usually voice, piano, or organ), teachers of general music, or for positions as instrumental directors (principal performance area in orchestral or band instruments) in public schools. Our students graduate earning a Standard Professional 1 (SP1) North Carolina Educator’s License and are prepared as informed, responsible citizens with the tools to succeed and communicate effectively as musicians and educators of the twenty-ﬁrst century. Music education students acquire valuable early ﬁeld teaching experience in a wide variety of P-12 school settings beginning the Freshman year and continuing throughout the degree program. Performance Studies Throughout the four years of undergraduate enrollment, music students will have the opportunity to study in one or more performance studies areas: keyboard, voice, strings, winds, percussion, jazz, or composition. This study will include private instruction in the major or principal performance area alongside group instruction. Ensemble Requirements All undergraduate Music students enrolled for two or more credit hours of music performance studies must audition for and perform in an ensemble each semester. Performance majors will participate in one or more ensembles each semester according to concentration requirements. Students will have the opportunity to express their ensemble placement preferences, but they will be assigned according to audition results and ensemble priorities. Ensemble assignments and placement will be determined by the Director of Instrumental Ensembles, Director of Choral Activities, and the Director of the Miles Davis Jazz Program, in consultation with the performance teachers and appropriate area coordinator. Each year advanced voice students may apply for roles in the performance of opera and musical theatre, which the departments of music present in cooperation with the School of Theatre. Student Information Manual Additional policies and regulations are found online in the Music Student Information Manual. This manual is made available to all music students after entrance requirements are met. Adherence to the contents of this publication is the responsibility of the student. Graduate Programs The Master of Music in Music Education leads to graduate licensure and emphasizes the acquisition of a fundamental knowledge of research techniques and scholarly writing standards. Students develop an in-depth understanding of the historical, philosophical, psychological and cultural aspects of music education. The Master of Music in Performance programs offer conservatory-type performance training and complement this with academic offerings directly related to careers in performance. These students graduate with performance and entrepreneurial skills enabling entry into the profession or further studies.  518 School of Music The Master of Music in Music Theory program offers students an opportunity to deepen and reﬁne their knowledge of music theory, and to continue developing their analytical, keyboard, and aural skills. Most M.M. students gain valuable teaching experience as graduate assistants. Students who complete this course of study are qualiﬁed to teach pre- college or community college courses, or to apply for admission to a doctoral program. Doctor of Musical Arts students are fully prepared as artist/scholars ready to join the academy. A large faculty of outstanding artists, teachers, and researchers supports a comprehensive program of study. The Doctor of Philosophy in Music Education prepares students for careers as public school music administrators or college-level teachers. Such development requires a comprehensive knowledge of the psychological, social and musical values in music education; theories of learning as applied to music education; historical and theoretical properties of music education; and scholarly and research techniques required for understanding and investigating problems in music and education.

It emphasizes a broad coverage of music rather than heavy concentration on any single segment. Studies develop musicianship, capabilities in the use of principles and procedures that lead to an intellectual grasp of the art, and the ability to perform. It serves individuals who seek a broad program of general education rather than intense specialization.

This includes all courses offered under the following preﬁxes: ACC, BUS, ECO, ENT, FIN, ISM, MKT, MGT, and SCM. Courses in the Bryan School may have additional prerequisites or enrollment restrictions that are outlined in the university schedule and the description of each course. Requirements for Majoring or Minoring in Bryan School Programs Students pursuing a major or minor in the Bryan School of Business and Economics must have a cumulative grade point average no less than a 2.0 on UNC Greensboro course work. Requests to major or minor in one of the Bryan School’s programs can be made online. After being accepted as a pre-major in the Bryan School, students must then work toward being fully admitted to a speciﬁc program of study. Criteria for Admission to Programs of Study in the Bryan School of Business and Economics Bryan School Pre-Admission Courses are listed within the requirements for each program. Application for Admission to Program of Study Students who have met the admission criteria will be notiﬁed of admission into their major by Bryan Undergraduate Student Services at the following intervals: • by October 15, if completing required admission course work during a fall semester • by March 15, if completing required admission course work during a spring semester • by July 15, if completing required admission course work during a summer semester. Departments may require additional steps in the admission to major process. Admission to a program of study my be denied in cases where additional enrollments would threaten the academic quality of classes or programs. Criteria for Continuing in the Bryan School of Business and Economics Students who have been admitted to the Bryan School of Business and Economics must be in good academic standing at UNC Greensboro, must maintain at least the GPA required for program admission, and must meet the continuation requirements of their programs of study. Transfers Since most of the courses in the major are taken during the junior and senior years, transfer students often complete their programs without extending their total stay beyond the usual four years. As a general guide, courses taught mainly to freshmen and sophomores here will usually, but not always, be accepted in transfer from accredited two-year colleges. Courses numbered 300 and above generally will not be accepted in transfer credit from two-year institutions. In order to allow timely completion of the required courses and required prerequisites, transfer students are encouraged to complete MAT 115 College Algebra or a higher level math. Second Baccalaureate Degrees Students pursuing a second bachelor’s degree must meet all requirements within the Bryan School. The Bryan School cannot, at this time, accommodate persons who seek only to complete a series of courses in one ﬁeld (such as Accounting or Information Systems). Suggested Academic Workload Guidelines The faculty of the Bryan School of Business and Economics recognizes that many Bryan School students hold jobs to support college expenses. The faculty wishes to emphasize that academic excellence and scholastic achievement usually require a signiﬁcant investment of time in study, research, and out-of-class projects. To provide guidance to students in planning their academic and work schedules, the faculty of the Bryan School have endorsed the following recommendations: 1. In general, students should plan to devote between 2–3 hours outside of class for each hour in class. Thus, students with a 15 credit hour course load should schedule between 30–45 hours weekly for completing outside-of-class reading, study, and homework assignments. 2. Students who are employed more than 5–10 hours each week should consider reducing their course loads, depending upon their study habits, learning abilities, and course work requirements. 3. Students should take into consideration that many business courses require group work and plan accordingly. Scholarships and Fellowships Procedures and requirements for applying for undergraduate scholarships are described in Financial Aid. Honors Programs The Bryan School supports and encourages students to participate in the Honors Programs administered by the Lloyd International Honors College.

Elder, Department Head Amanda Cromartie, Graduate Program Director Mission Statement The mission of the Department of Accounting and Finance of the Joseph M. Bryan School of Business and Economics is 1. to provide high quality programs of education for accounting and ﬁnance majors at the undergraduate and graduate levels 2. to provide high quality courses to support the UNC Greensboro and Bryan School educational missions as they relate accounting and ﬁnance to global processes, sustainable enterprise, innovation and ethical awareness 3. to stimulate and support high quality research, scholarship, and publication 4. to provide service, largely through committee representation to the University, the Bryan School, the Department, the academic accounting and ﬁnance communities, and the accounting profession, and 5. to foster faculty interaction with the public in ways which enhance the common good. The primary goal of the department is to provide programs of quality education in accounting and ﬁnance at the undergraduate and graduate levels. The undergraduate program provides an excellent foundation for careers in industry and is sufﬁciently broad to qualify graduates for a wide range of entry-level, business-related positions; and prepares students for further graduate-level studies in areas such as accounting, ﬁnance, law, and business administration. Our accounting programs are separately accredited by The Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB), the premier accrediting agency for business programs worldwide. Accounting is the only discipline within business for which separate accreditation is given. With this designation, we are among the top 1% of programs worldwide. We strive to maintain the quality and continuous improvement expected from programs which have achieved AACSB business and accounting accreditation. The Department of Accounting and Finance also offers a Bachelor of Science degree with a major in ﬁnance. The undergraduate ﬁnance program deals with the theory, organization, and operation of the ﬁnancial system from both a market and a managerial viewpoint. Students are expected to develop analytical abilities and to present their analyses in both written and oral form. Undergraduate majors are offered a broad range of courses from the areas of ﬁnancial management, ﬁnancial institutions, and investments. Graduates may take managerial positions in controllership or treasury work in non-ﬁnancial businesses as well as a wide array of careers in ﬁnancial services and banking. In addition, the degree may lead to positions in risk management and real estate departments of public agencies and private corporations as well as insurance and real estate companies. At the graduate level, the Bryan School offers courses in ﬁnance as part of the Master of Business Administration (M.B.A.) program. Student Learning Goals Critical thinking, quantitative aptitude, teamwork, and good communication skills are necessary to function effectively in today’s highly competitive, global environment. In order to assure that our graduates are prepared to meet the challenges of the future: • Students will demonstrate problem solving skills and demonstrate technical competence necessary for entry-level accounting careers or entry into graduate programs in accounting. • Students will demonstrate the ability to communicate effectively and efﬁciently. • Students will have an understanding of ethical decision-making and understand the role of professional ethics including the importance of ethical conduct and decisions to the sustainability of the accounting profession. • Finance students will be able to create forward-looking ﬁnancial statements. • Finance students will be able to analyze the current ﬁnancial condition of the ﬁrm. • Finance students will be able to thoroughly understand the mathematical process and application of capital budgeting. • Finance Students will thoroughly understand the concepts of the time value of money (TVM), the characteristics of traditional ﬁnancial securities, and the valuation of these securities.

The M.S. in Accounting is one of the longest running and most successful programs in graduate-level accounting education in North Carolina and is among the top 1% of programs worldwide to have supplemental AACSB accreditation. The program satisﬁes the 150- hour educational requirement adopted by most states, including North Carolina, for certiﬁcation and licensure as a CPA. The program has a strong reputation for its internship program and job placement as well as an excellent record of preparing students to pass the CPA examination. In addition, students in the M.S in Accounting program have the option to specialize in Tax or Financial Reporting and Assurance. The M.S. in Accounting program admits students from all backgrounds. For students that have fulﬁlled the essential prerequisites, the program requires 30 credit hours of graduate course work. The program has a flexible structure designed to be full-time for the intensive student or part-time for the working professional. Due to the importance of a strong accounting foundation, students whose previous accounting course work indicate deﬁciency in one or more accounting courses may be required to complete one or more prerequisite courses as part of the program. We also offer a professional entry option for students holding previous non-accounting degrees and who now have an interest in preparing for careers in public accounting, consulting, and corporate accounting. This option is also ideal for students who have an undergraduate degree in accounting from outside of the United States. The professional entry option requires any necessary qualifying prerequisite courses and two additional required core courses. Applicants are expected to have a basic business background including an introduction to economics, statistics, ﬁnancial accounting, and managerial accounting. Applicants that do not have this background will be expected to meet these minimum requirements before beginning the M.S. in Accounting program. These basic businesses courses are offered each semester, including summer. It is possible for students in need of these courses to apply to begin in the fall term and take any necessary introductory courses over the summer. Most full-time students can complete the program in 12 to 18 months, and most part-time students can complete the program in 24 to 36 months.

These concentrations prepare students for positions with companies that focus on the process of concept to consumer for apparel and consumer- related products. Graduates may take positions in apparel design, apparel product development, fashion trend forecasting and analysis, quality control, sourcing, merchandising, buying, and retail management. During the ﬁrst two years of study, students will complete the majority of their general education requirements and begin introductory consumer, apparel, and retailing courses. In order to develop a strong knowledge base and build upon previously learned concepts, many of these courses are sequential and must be completed in the established order. International exposure is built into the curriculum. Study of foreign languages is encouraged and international study experiences are possible. All majors take supporting courses in the Bryan School of Business and Economics. Students in the Retailing and Consumer Studies concentration can elect to fulﬁll a business minor with two additional Business electives. The Apparel Design concentration is restricted to a limited number of students in the studio courses. All students wishing to enroll in the Apparel Design studio courses must submit an Apparel Design Application. Only students who have formal, written acceptance into the Apparel Design studio courses will be permitted to register in APD 251, APD 252, APD 341, and APD 443. Admission to the university does not guarantee acceptance into the Apparel Design studio courses. In all cases, admission is competitive and limited by space available in the program. Internship experiences are required of all CARS students through a structured two-course sequence that includes a professional development class that prepares them both to ﬁnd internships and to achieve successful internship experiences. The CARS Internship Program Coordinator structures and supervises internships to ensure quality experiences. Because of the proximity to North Carolina’s strong apparel and retailing industries, the majority of students have internships within the state; however, the long-standing relationships between CARS and the apparel, fashion, and retailing industries link students to opportunities for out-of-state internships in such exciting places as New York City, Atlanta, and the West Coast. The Department of Consumer, Apparel, and Retail Studies offers graduate programs leading to a Post-Baccalaureate Certiﬁcate and the Master of Science and Doctor of Philosophy degrees. Course work and research focus on primary concepts in the study of consumer, apparel, and retailing, integrating perspectives from the social sciences, business, economics, and humanities. Graduate courses focus on consumer, apparel, and retail issues with emphasis on consumer behavior and marketing. Students are encouraged to select supporting course work in related disciplines such as business, economics, sociology, psychology, anthropology, statistics, and information science.

The department’s undergraduate courses and programs prepare students for the competitive global marketplace, career and professional development, and graduate education. Its innovative graduate programs, the M.A. in Applied Economics and the Ph.D. in Economics with a focus on applied microeconomics, provide students with a mastery of advanced empirical and analytical methods so they can conduct high-quality research and contribute to the knowledge base in business, government, nonproﬁt, and research settings. The department conducts high-quality nationally recognized research that supports its academic programs, promotes economic understanding, and fosters economic development in the Triad and in the State. Undergraduate Economics is a discipline concerned with the choices made by people, ﬁrms, and governments and with public policies that affect those choices including protection of the environment, the quality and cost of health care, business productivity, inflation and unemployment, poverty, globalization, and the material well-being of the residents of the nation and of the planet. The Department of Economics offers both Bachelor of Science in Economics (B.S.) and Bachelor of Arts in Economics (B.A.) undergraduate degrees through the Bryan School of Business and Economics. These undergraduate programs prepare students for careers in business, government, or not-for-proﬁt organizations that involve the application of economic analysis and methods or for entry into post graduate degree programs. Graduate The faculty of the Department of Economics has an established national reputation for scholarship in applied microeconomic research. The department’s graduate programs are specially focused on developing the theoretical and econometric tools required to formulate and interpret quality empirical research and the data handling and communication skills required to conduct and disseminate the outcomes of that research. Programs of study offered by the Department of Economics at the graduate level include both a Master of Arts in Applied Economics (M.A.), a Doctor of Philosophy in Economics (Ph.D.), and two graduate certiﬁcates. Students without a completed master's degree in economics can apply directly to the Ph.D. program through the M.A. in Applied Economics Doctoral Track. This enables prospective students with only a bachelor's degree to be admitted to the Ph.D. program and complete the M.A. in Applied Economics degree as part of their graduate plan of study.

Required Milestones* • Residency (Immersion) – Doctoral students in the on-campus program are expected to satisfy a residence requirement, which provides them the opportunity for an extended period of intensive study and intellectual and professional development among a community of scholars. The basic requirement is two consecutive semesters (minimum of 6 credits per semester) of graduate course work (excluding independent study and dissertation hours) on the Greensboro campus after admission to a doctoral program. The online Ph.D. program requires three campus visits. The ﬁrst is to take place prior to a student’s ﬁrst semester. The purpose of the second visit is to take the qualifying exams and to meet with the dissertation committee to agree on a plan of study. The third and ﬁnal visit can be the proposal defense, the dissertation defense, or a second in-person meeting with the committee at another time. University requirements aside, a critical aspect of the graduate experience is participation in events beyond the course work requirements. Graduate students are expected to attend professional conferences, seminars, lectures, and Brown Bags, and participate in professional development activities sponsored by the Department, the Bryan School, or the Graduate  UNC Greensboro 2023-24 University Catalog 585 School. Economics graduate students are highly encouraged to present and/or publish their research. • Qualifying Exams – In addition to the course requirements, doctoral students must pass two Ph.D. qualifying examinations. These examinations take place typically after the ﬁrst year of doctoral studies following the completion of the advanced theory course work and will focus on a student’s comprehensive knowledge in the areas of economic theory and econometrics, respectively. Students are required to pass both examinations in order to retain placement in the doctoral program. Students who do not pass either or both examination(s) may retake the failed examination(s) one time. • Advisory/Dissertation Committee – Students must form an Advisory/ Dissertation Committee before the end of their ﬁrst year. The committee (minimum of three members) must be formalized with the Graduate School. The Committee Chair will serve as the student's primary advisor and mentor throughout their dissertation. • Research Competency – Work on the dissertation proposal takes place in supervised research seminars under the guidance and supervision of the student’s Advisory/Dissertation Committee: ECO 797 Seminar in Empirical Economics andECO 798 Seminar in Economic Research. The preliminary written and oral examination takes place after submission of the dissertation proposal and is expected to occur by the end of the semester in which the student completes the ECO 798 requirement. • Plan of Study – The Graduate School requires students to ﬁle a plan of study outlining all the courses they will take or have taken to meet the requirements of your graduate degree. Graduate students are expected to ﬁle a preliminary plan of study with the Graduate School no later than the semester in which they complete 18 credits of graduate study. This preliminary plan is completed by the student in consultation with the Director of Graduate Study and must be approved by the student’s dissertation committee chair and members. • Written Dissertation Proposal and Written Part of the Comprehensive Examination – The student will prepare a written Dissertation Proposal and submit that written proposal to their dissertation committee. Following that submission, the written part of the Comprehensive Examination is scheduled and prepared by the dissertation advisor with the assistance of the dissertation committee. Questions may cover any aspect of the course work taken by the student during the period of this graduate study or any subject logically related and basic to an understanding of the subject matter of the major area of study. Any transferred course work is subject to examination at the time of the comprehensive examination. • Oral Part of the Comprehensive Examination and Oral Presentation of the Dissertation Proposal – The oral part of the Comprehensive Examination should be scheduled within one month following the written part of the Comprehensive Examination, and the entire dissertation committee must participate. The oral part of the comprehensive Examination will consist of an oral presentation of the dissertation proposal and a discussion in which the student responds to questions posed by the dissertation committee and which occurs after the oral presentation of the dissertation proposal. The content of these questions is at the discretion of the dissertation committee. • Assessment – After the oral part of the Comprehensive Examination has concluded, the dissertation committee meets privately to evaluate the dissertation proposal, the written part of the Comprehensive Examination, and the oral part of the Comprehensive Examination. The committee then decides whether the student has passed without conditions, passed conditionally, or failed the preliminary examination. The student is then informed of the result. • Admission to Candidacy – A minimum of 12 credits will be devoted to research that culminates in the preparation of the required doctoral dissertation. • Before registering for dissertation credit (ECO 799 Dissertation), Ph.D. students should be admitted to candidacy by the Graduate School. To make formal application for admission to candidacy, the student must have completed all major required courses, have passed their qualifying examinations, have submitted a dissertation proposal that has been approved by their advisory/ dissertation committee, and have passed both the written and oral parts of their Comprehensive Examination. • After being admitted to candidacy for the doctoral degree, the candidate must prepare and present a dissertation that reflects an independent investigation of an economic topic that is acceptable in form and content to the students Advisory/ Dissertation Committee and the Graduate School. • Dissertation Defense – Doctoral candidates will successfully pass an oral examination of their independent dissertation study to members of their doctoral committee. The defense must be formally scheduled with the Graduate School at least two weeks in advance. The defense is open to all members of the University community who may wish to attend, as required by state laws on public meetings. However, the deliberations of the Dissertation Committee are private. • Filing the Final Approved Dissertation – The Graduate School requires electronic dissertation submission. The dissertation must be ﬁled in compliance with Graduate School policies and guidelines for acceptable formatting and deadlines. The Graduate School dissertation templates should be used to mitigate errors or delays. • Job Market Paper – Along with the process of preparing and defending a dissertation, graduating Ph.D. students are expected as an integral part of the dissertation process to prepare a job market paper in preparation for job interviews. Doctoral students planning to participate in the market are expected to have a completed market- ready paper and presentation prepared no later than September of the preceding year. * General information about milestones for doctoral programs is available in Section III (p. 826) of the Graduate Policies (p. 807) page in the University Catalog. For information about how milestones are accomplished for a speciﬁc program, please refer to the doctoral program's handbook. Economics of Health Analytics, Post- Baccalaureate Certiﬁcate The Post-Baccalaureate Certiﬁcate in the Economics of Health Analytics is designed for individuals currently working in health care ﬁelds as well as those considering such work who are interested in learning how to analyze health care issues from an economic perspective. The certiﬁcate focuses on health policy, health econometrics, analytics, and data skills. Students learn to manage and use data to evaluate new health care policies, technologies and programs with cutting edge statistical tools.  586 Quantitative Business Economics, Post-Baccalaureate Certiﬁcate The P.B.C. is composed of four courses that can be completed in as little as two semesters.  Admission in either the fall or the spring semester is possible. Completion of the P.B.C. in Economics of Health Analytics allows the the GMAT/GRE admission requirement for the Masters of Arts in Applied Economics to be waived; courses completed as part of the certiﬁcate program may count toward completion of the M.A. subject to the Graduate School policy on time limits for master's degrees. Students may pursue a post-baccalaureate certiﬁcate concurrently with a master's degree in Applied Economics. Courses taken as part of the certiﬁcate program may also satisfy degree requirements subject to Graduate School policy. Certiﬁcates function similarly to a cognate, which is course work organized around a narrow subﬁeld. Certiﬁcates provide master's students with the ability to earn enhanced credentials. Enrolled master's students do not have to pay the application fee to pursue a concurrent certiﬁcate. Student Learning Outcomes • Policy analysis in health economics. • Identify and characterize policy issues in health and healthcare. • Use economic theory to analyze policy issues in health and healthcare. • Use economic theory to analyze policy issues in health and healthcare. • Manage, clean, and use data sets to construct descriptive, graphical, and statistical representations of economic phenomena. • Diagnose and identify data issues.

Quantitative Business Economics, Post-Baccalaureate Certiﬁcate The Post-Baccalaureate Certiﬁcate in Quantitative Business Economics is designed for individuals interested in developing broad perspectives on the use of economics in evaluating business decision making. The certiﬁcate delivers high-demand skills such as time series and forecasting, managerial economics, policy evaluation, and the ability to develop and evaluate the models used for stress testing. The P.B.C. in Quantitative Business Economics is composed of four courses that can be completed in as little as two semesters.  Admission in either the fall or the spring semester is possible. Completion of the P.B.C. in Quantitative Business Economics allows the the GMAT/GRE admission requirement for the Masters of Arts in Applied Economics to be waived; courses completed as part of the certiﬁcate program may count toward completion of the M.A. subject to the Graduate School policy on time limits for master's degrees. Students may pursue a post-baccalaureate certiﬁcate concurrently with a master's degree in Applied Economics. Courses taken as part of the certiﬁcate program may also satisfy degree requirements subject to Graduate School policy. Certiﬁcates function similarly to a cognate, which is course work organized around a narrow subﬁeld. Certiﬁcates provide master's students with the ability to earn enhanced credentials. Enrolled master's students do not have to pay the application fee to pursue a concurrent certiﬁcate. Student Learning Outcomes • Microeconomic Theory. Students will apply microeconomic theory to business decision making. • Prepare Data for Economic Analysis. Manage, clean, and use data sets to construct descriptive, graphical, and statistical representations of economic phenomena. Diagnose and identify data issues. • Econometrics.

A third priority is to provide service through involvement in university, professional and community activities. The Department of Management offers two majors that lead to the Bachelor of Science degree: Business Administration and International Business Studies. The Business Administration major is comprised of three concentrations: Business Studies, Human Resources, and Management. Business Administration Major The objective of the Business Administration major is to provide liberally educated students with a broad exposure to the functional areas of business and a more comprehensive understanding of one of the managerial specialties through a choice of a concentration: • Business Studies is most appropriate for those who want a broad business exposure without the need to concentrate speciﬁcally in only one functional area. (A student can complete the Business Studies concentration by careful planning of the Career Proﬁle.) • Human Resources focuses on skills and knowledge needed by the professional human resources manager: job analysis, recruiting, screening, selection, training and development, performance appraisal, job evaluation, and salary administration. • Management focuses on courses in the management area with courses in leadership, organizational behavior, human resources, decision-making, cross cultural management, and strategy. The concentration is designed for students that want a more focused education on issues and problems faced by those involved in business management. International Business Studies Major The International Business Studies major is distinctive in the Bryan School by requiring experiences and competence in areas such as language and study abroad that are not required in other business programs. The need to understand other cultures, societies, and economies is met by requiring/recommending more in liberal education and related areas than is required in General Education requirements for other business programs.

Approximately 75% of our students are enrolled in graduate programs and 25% are enrolled in undergraduate programs. The faculty of the SOE includes nearly 100 full-time professors who are highly accomplished scholars, teachers, and partners with community organizations and schools. The Departments in the School of Education are as follows: • Counseling and Educational Development • Educational Leadership and Cultural Foundations • Educational Research Methodology • Library and Information Science • Specialized Educational Services • Teacher Education and Higher Education The Department of Teacher Education and Higher Education and the Department of Specialized Education Services offer Bachelor of Science programs several of which prepare students for the Standard Professional I License in North Carolina. Undergraduate majors include Elementary Education, Middle Grades Education, Interpreting, Deaf Education, and Advocacy Services (Advocacy and Services for the Deaf; Auditory-Oral/Birth–Kindergarten Teacher Licensure; Birth–12 Deaf and Hard of Hearing Teacher Licensure; and Interpreter Preparation), Special Education (including the Dual Elementary Education and Special Education Concentration with Teacher Licensure), and Elementary Education . All departments in the School of Education offer graduate programs leading to master’s, specialist’s, and doctoral degrees, as well. The School of Education also supports programs in teacher education conducted under the auspices of other schools (Visual and Performing Arts; Health and Human Sciences) and departments within the College of Arts and Sciences by responding to course requirements in the areas of social, philosophical, and psychological foundations; methodology; curriculum; and student teaching. Recent emphases in competency- based curricula and individualized programming contribute to newly designed teacher education programs. All licensure programs for school personnel are approved by the North Carolina State Department of Public Instruction. The University of North Carolina at Greensboro is accredited under the National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education (NCATE) Standards through the CAEP Accreditation System, for a period of six years, from 2015-21. UNC Greensboro will seek accreditation under the Council for the Accreditation of Educator Preparation (CAEP) Standards in 2021. Formed in 2013, CAEP is the single specialized accreditor for educator preparation, and administers NCATE accreditation. The School of Education is a professional school that strives to prepare outstanding practitioners, study the profession, create and disseminate new knowledge in professional education, and engage in ﬁeld services and apply research ﬁndings. A general discussion of Teacher Education may be found under School of Education Licensure Programs in this catalog. The SOE offers over 20 different graduate degree programs, many of which include a range of specialty concentrations to allow our students to focus on topics most relevant to their interests and professional goals.

Wester, Chair of the Department L. DiAnne Borders, Graduate Program Director About There are two primary program areas in counselor education for which the master’s and doctoral degrees are offered: clinical mental health counseling and school counseling. Within these two program areas, the Council for Accreditation of Counseling and Related Educational Programs (CACREP), a specialized accrediting body recognized by the Council on Postsecondary Accreditation (COPA), has conferred accreditation to the following programs and specializations in the Department of Counseling and Educational Development at UNC Greensboro: clinical mental health counseling (M.S.), school counseling (M.S.), couple and family counseling (M.S.), and counseling and counselor education (Ph.D.). Applicants admitted to a program are expected to enroll as full-time students, registering for a minimum of 12 credit hours each semester. Students appointed to graduate assistantships, however, may reduce their credit load and retain full-time status. Curriculum The Counselor Education program faculty adheres to the scientist- practitioner model of training. Consistent with this approach is the program’s goal of graduating students who have broad knowledge of counseling theory and process, possess a high level of competency in providing professional services to diverse client populations, and view assessment and research in counseling as a continuous cyclical activity throughout the counseling process. Research is a means of obtaining and using information to generate and establish counseling goals and strategies, and for identifying “best practices” or empirically-based practices that are integral to effectiveness in counseling. The focus of this ongoing process is to bring about client change. The major tenets underlying the program include the following: 1. Exposure to a variety of theoretical orientations to counseling, 2. Reliance on both the clinical-counseling and vocational-educational approaches in designing counseling and programmatic interventions, 3. A commitment to developing the student’s skills as a clinician who uses research methodology in practice, 4. A strong emphasis on the normal developmental issues of the individual as opposed to an approach based on pathology, and 5. Intentionality around challenging students to increase their self- awareness about and knowledge of diverse populations, and to use culturally-appropriate interventions in an effort to become multiculturally competent practitioners. Especially important to the program faculty are the commitment to mental “health” (or wellness) and the value attached to understanding the common developmental themes throughout a person’s life. An appealing feature is the diversity of the faculty’s theoretical orientations, which translates into a variety of research opportunities available to creative students, as well as varied counseling approaches and different applied settings for gaining training experience. To achieve the program’s curriculum goals of the scientist-practitioner model of training, students are required to demonstrate satisfactory knowledge in each of the following core areas: the helping relationship; group dynamics, process, and counseling; social and cultural diversity; human growth and development; career and lifestyle development; appraisal of individuals; research and evaluation; and professional orientation. Available within the program requirements are courses offered by other departments that enable students to beneﬁt from the resources of the entire University. Required professional core courses constitute the cognitive foundation for the development of skills in providing professional services. Also available are specialized courses dealing with particular groups and environmental settings, such as courses in family intervention, counseling children and adolescents, and substance use. Supervised clinical experience in the Vacc Counseling and Consulting Clinic is offered throughout the program parallel to core and specialty courses. Supervised experience in applied settings is available on campus as well as at off-campus sites; these include community mental health services; career counseling and placement; inpatient facilities; college counseling centers; public and private K-12 schools; child, youth, and family agencies; and sports, outreach, and alcohol and drug programs. Students are encouraged to explore internship experiences speciﬁcally tailored to their individual needs and interests. This diversity of opportunities allows students to develop programs consistent with their own particular goals and talents. Students are given strong encouragement to participate in professional organizations and collaborate on original research projects. Opportunities for professional involvement and leadership development include the student honor association in the Department as well as state and national counseling organizations. Applied research courses are available at the entry level and required at the doctoral level. To help students design and complete high quality, relevant dissertations, doctoral students are required to take courses in research design and statistics, and quantitative and qualitative methods of data analysis. In addition to being given strong encouragement to participate in original research projects and presentations at professional meetings, students are expected to work closely with their selected professors in conducting their research projects. Close consultation with the faculty is strongly encouraged, particularly for students working on doctoral dissertations. The faculty views doctoral research as providing students with a starting point for developing an ongoing research program that continues beyond completion of their degree. Mechanisms for student evaluation include progress evaluations by instructors, practicum supervisors, and internship supervisors - both at the University and at internship sites. Capstone projects and comprehensive exams provide valuable feedback to students regarding their progress in the program. Faculty supervisors appraise students' clinical skills, and this feedback is available to students. A majority of M.S. students complete the required curriculum in two years. Ph.D. students generally complete their degree in three years. Although a few doctoral students complete their dissertations after their full-time study at the University, students are strongly encouraged to complete all degree requirements before leaving.  UNC Greensboro 2023-24 University Catalog 619 Graduates are eligible for one or more state and national credentials. Because the program is CACREP-approved, all fully enrolled master’s students can take the National Counselor Examination for Licensure and Certiﬁcation (NCE) during their last semester of the program. The NCE is the ﬁrst step toward becoming a National Certiﬁed Counselor (NCC) and a Licensed Clinical Mental Health Counselor (LCMHC) in North Carolina. In addition, the post-master’s experience requirement for the NCC credential is waived. The NCC credential is a prerequisite for national specialty certiﬁcations offered by the National Board of Certiﬁed Counselors (NBCC), including school counseling and clinical mental health counseling. School counseling graduates are eligible for the “G” state school counseling license. Those who complete the Post-Baccalaureate Certiﬁcate in Mental Health in Children and Adolescents are eligible for the ""S"" state school counseling license. Graduates of the clinical mental health counseling specialization in couple and family counseling qualify for the National Academy for Certiﬁed Family Therapist (NACFT) credential and can also receive preparation for American Association of Marriage and Family Therapy (AAMFT) membership (see Departmental Ofﬁce Manager for additional information). For aspiring substance use counselors, preparation is available for both the Certiﬁed Alcohol and Drug Counselor pre- certiﬁcation and the Licensed Clinical Addiction Specialist-Associate. Recent graduates of the program have accepted positions in diverse settings similar to the breadth of internships available for students. The interest and talents of the students have served as the major criteria for determining the type of internship and employment obtained. Professor L.

The ELC faculty seek to prepare thoughtful and effective leaders in education through programs of study that are interdisciplinary in focus and that emphasize questions of moral concern, the cultural context of education, and a reconstructive vision for excellent and equitable schooling. Our purpose is to create change agents who work with parents, staff, students, and communities to develop critical understandings of the assumptions, beliefs, and regularities that support schooling and who identify and create practices that allow schools to function more fully as democracies while preparing students for democracy. The department offers three graduate degree programs and two certiﬁcate programs: Master of School Administration, Doctor of Education in Educational Leadership, and Doctor of Philosophy in Educational Studies with a concentration in Cultural Foundations and Post Masters in School Administration and Post Masters in Cultural Foundations and Social Justice Education. As a valued member of our academic community, you will have the advantage of a supportive environment in which you are known, cared for, challenged and invested in. Faculty members take your preparation and your success very seriously. For that same reason, we equip you with more than knowledge; we give you the tools and experience to understand what your future decisions in the ﬁeld will mean to learners and how you can use your position to bring about positive change for education. ELC is committed to embodying our shared commitments in all of our actions, with social justice and equity as the expressed centerpiece of who we are. A major component of this department is an undergraduate course, ELC 281 Cultural Foundations of Education, which is required of all students who are planning to seek teacher licensure.

Students may select licensure programs in a variety of subject areas. The School of Education offers programs in Elementary Education, Middle Grades Education, Interpreting, Deaf Education, and Advocacy Services, and Special Education; and jointly directs, with departments in the College of Arts and Sciences, programs for teacher licensure in core academic subjects at the secondary level. The School of Health and Human Sciences, the College of Visual and Performing Arts, and the College of Arts and Sciences, in collaboration with the School of Education, offer teacher education curricula. Graduates of approved teacher education curricula are eligible for initial licensure on the basis of UNC Greensboro’s recommendation to the State Department of Public Instruction. As requirements may vary among departments, students should check with their major advisor for speciﬁc information regarding their program. Important information for all education students at UNC Greensboro can be found in the Teacher Education Handbook. Admission to Teacher Education All students who wish to be recommended for teacher licensure in any of the subject areas must be admitted to a speciﬁc Teacher Education Program. Students should apply for admission to Teacher Education at the end of their sophomore year and be admitted no later than the ﬁrst semester of their junior year. The following requirements must be met:  654 School of Education Initial Licensure Programs 1. Grade point average of at least 2.70 (some departments require a GPA higher than a 2.70 to be admitted to teacher education). To determine if students meet this standard, the grade point average (GPA) is calculated using all relevant undergraduate course work. 2. Recommendation of the school or department where major is to be taken 3. Achievement of minimum score requirements as set by the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction on the Professional Assessment for Beginning Teachers (Praxis Core, ACT, or SAT) 4. Completion of at least 12 credit hours at UNC Greensboro. The 12 credits shall be waived for any transfer student who meets ALL of the aforementioned requirements for admission to Teacher Education. The grade point average for transfer students will be the transferable GPA as computed by the Ofﬁce of Undergraduate Admissions. 5. Background check requested through UNC Greensboro’s afﬁliated company as described in the Teacher Education Handbook. For additional requirements speciﬁc to a program, students should check with their major school or department. Students should contact the Ofﬁce of Student Success (located in the School of Education Building, 334-3410) for: 1. Clariﬁcation of admission requirements. 2. Appeal of the application of a rule or regulation. More information on this topic can be found in the Teacher Education Handbook. Admission to Student Teaching During the junior year, students already admitted to the Teacher Education Program must apply for admission to Student Teaching. Student Teaching admission includes: 1. Grade point average of at least 2.70 (some departments require a GPA higher than a 2.70 for student teaching). 2. Approval of the school or department in which the student is majoring. 3. Completion of additional requirements speciﬁc to the major department or school teacher education program. Application forms are available online from the School of Education Licensure Programs website. Forms must be submitted by November 1 for student teaching in the fall of the following year, and by February 15 for student teaching in the spring of the following year. Student teaching assignments are usually made in schools within commuting distance of UNC Greensboro. Teacher education students are individually responsible for expenses incurred during student teaching, including transportation. Student teaching in some subject areas is offered only in either the fall or the spring semester. Any student who plans to student teach should check with his or her major program about when student teaching will be offered in a particular subject area. More information on this topic can be found in the Teacher Education Handbook. General and Professional Education Requirements Requirements for teacher licensure are speciﬁed in the respective program descriptions. Candidates should know program speciﬁc requirements. This information is available on the department websites, handbooks of their licensure programs, and/or in the University Catalog. Students should also speak with their advisors about admission requirements as all licensure programs rely heavily on early and adequate advising. Second Academic Concentration Requirement All students majoring in Elementary, Middle Grades, and Physical Education are required to complete an approved second academic concentration consisting of a minimum of 18 credit hours in a basic academic discipline or an approved interdisciplinary ﬁeld of study. Depending on the academic discipline selected, a maximum of 6 credit hours may be counted toward General Education requirements and the second concentration. This requirement became effective for all students who entered the university in Fall 2005.  Students should check with the major school and/or department about this requirement or additional requirements speciﬁc to individual programs. Teacher Licensure in Comprehensive Secondary Social Studies Students majoring in anthropology, geography, history, political science, psychology, or sociology, can seek teacher licensure in comprehensive secondary social studies. Students seeking social studies licensure must take a total of 18 credit hours in history and economics beyond their major requirements from the departments of anthropology, political science, psychology, and sociology. Because history majors need to achieve breadth in social science content and methods, history majors must complete an additional 15 hours of social science electives. Courses must be selected from the following approved list. This list is also available from the School of Education Ofﬁce of Student Success (School of Education Building), the student’s major advisor, or the social studies advisor in the School of Education. Substitution of any requirements needed for licensure may be made by the social studies advisor in the School of Education. Application for Teacher Licensure An application for licensure should be ﬁled with the Ofﬁce of Student Success within two weeks of graduation. Students should be aware that the licensure process will take six weeks or longer after graduation to be completed. UNC Greensboro recommends for a teacher’s licensure those students who have completed the appropriate teacher education curriculum, attained acceptable competencies, submitted the appropriate state board licensure exams, and whose work has been approved by the appropriate department.  Meeting these guidelines will move students forward to attain licensure in the State of North Carolina. Teacher Education Curricula Programs in teacher education are offered at UNC Greensboro in the four broad areas listed below. Their description is found under the school and/ or department listed beside each program.

The Master of Arts in Teaching is designed for candidates who have a bachelor’s degree but did not pursue teacher education or licensure as an undergraduate. All concentrations in this track will also have prerequisite or corequisite courses, which are required for teaching licensure in North Carolina. The prerequisite or corequisite courses must be completed before a candidate can be recommended for licensure. A list of prerequisite or corequisite courses is available on the Teacher Education and Higher Education website at http:// soe.uncg.edu/academics/departments/tehe/tehe-programs/ or the School of Education's list of majors and degrees (http://soe.uncg.edu/ academics/majors-and-degrees/).

The programs include the study of the development of individuals and families throughout the life span, seeking to improve their well-being through the creation, use, and dissemination of knowledge. Programs of study in the department are multidisciplinary, requiring a synthesis of knowledge from the social and behavioral sciences and from the ﬁeld of education. The goal of the Department of Human Development and Family Studies is to provide the best opportunity in North Carolina for undergraduates to prepare for careers in child, adolescent, adult, and family care services; in the care and education of children with/without disabilities from birth to kindergarten; teaching in community child care programs and in preschool and kindergarten classrooms in the public school; and in cooperative extension and state agencies. The internship program within the department provides students with opportunities for professional experiences in the career ﬁeld of their choice. The department also administers the Child Care Education Program at three sites with an enrollment of 80 children in all-day child care. All serve as laboratories for the study of children and their families. The Department of Human Development and Family Studies faculty have a wide range of research interests and methodological approaches. The faculty’s research interests cluster in ﬁve focal areas: • Early childhood development, care, and education including social, emotional, and cognitive development in young children, child care, and early childhood education; • Parent-child relationships; • Adolescence; • Close relationships, marriage, and divorce; and • Human development and family diversity in sociocultural context. Faculty use a variety of quantitative and qualitative approaches including tests of children’s social and cognitive development, micro-analytic analyses of peer and parent-child interactions, surveys, interviews, feminist methodologies such as photovoice and interpretive inquiry, and the design and evaluation of educational and intervention programs for children, family members, and educational personnel. Within these general areas of concentration and varied methods of inquiry, students focus upon more speciﬁc topics of study. Graduate course work in human development and family studies focuses on individuals and families as they relate to friendship and kinship networks, the workplace, and economic, human service, health, and formal and informal educational systems. Graduate students have considerable flexibility in tailoring their studies to special interests and career goals. The department also offers several graduate programs jointly with the Department of Specialized Education Services: a M.Ed. in Birth-Kindergarten Interdisciplinary Studies in Education and Development; a Post-Baccalaureate Certiﬁcate in Birth-Kindergarten Initial Licensure; a Post-Baccalaureate Certiﬁcate in Leadership in Infant and Toddler Learning; and an Add-On Licensure in Birth through Kindergarten. For information about these programs, see the Birth Through Kindergarten section under Interdisciplinary Programs (p. 770). Professor Stephanie Irby CoardG Mark Allen FineG Anne C.

Kinesiology, M.S./Ph.D. The combined M.S./Ph.D. track in Kinesiology consists of a minimum of 78 credit hours beyond the baccalaureate degree and is intended for the most exceptional students (see Application and Admission section). It is anticipated that completion of the M.S./Ph.D. track will reasonably span ﬁve years. By the end of Year 2, students will enroll in a minimum of 6 credits of integrative/research related activity to meet the requirements of the M.S. degree if they choose not to continue on to completion of the Ph.D. degree. For those students already enrolled in the M.S. degree, it is expected their M.S. course work will already include many of the foundational courses for their discipline. In this case, additional course work in Years 3 and 4 will primarily consist of intensive research and dissertation credits. Speciﬁc course work will be determined by the student’s advisor and advisory committee, consistent with each sub- discipline. For information regarding deadlines and requirements for admission, please see https://grs.uncg.edu/programs/. In addition to the application materials required by the Graduate School, applicants must submit supplementary application materials required by the department. Exceptional students who have an appropriate baccalaureate degree and who demonstrate superior ability and a high level of motivation and dedication to research and learning are eligible to apply directly into the M.S./Ph.D. track. Current master’s degree students in Kinesiology who wish to pursue the Ph.D. may apply once they have completed at least 18 credits of foundational course work in their discipline, have demonstrated dedication to research, and have not yet formally proposed their thesis. Students must apply for admittance to the M.S./Ph.D. and must identify one of the possible concentration areas (Applied Neuromechanics, Exercise Physiology, Curriculum and Pedagogy Studies in Physical Education, Sport and Exercise Psychology, or Kinesiology.) Degree Program Requirements Required: 78 credit hours Requirements • Breadth Requirement (0-6 credits). Please see description under M.S. degree program requirements. • Integrative experience (6 credits) • Research methods (3 credits) • Research tools and statistics (12 credits) • Independent doctoral research (KIN 795 Independent Doctoral Research ) or equivalent (minimum of 6 credits) • Electives in major concentration area (33 credits) • Dissertation (12 credits) Items 1-3 plus 15-21 credits of electives are required to complete the M.S. degree. (See the requirements for the M.S. Thesis and Non-Thesis options.) Items 1-7 are required to complete the M.S./Ph.D. A minimum of 9 credits must be in courses numbered 750 and above. Program Progression Year One 18 credits of coursework, to include courses related to the research process Benchmark: Preliminary screening (early/mid semester 2) Year Two 18 credits of coursework, to include courses related to the research process Benchmark: Oral and written demonstration of research competence (end of semester 2) Years Three and Four Completion of remaining coursework Benchmark: Comprehensive examination (oral and written) Year Five 12 credits of dissertation Benchmark: Completion of and oral defense of dissertation Required Benchmarks Continued progression in the M.S./Ph.D. track is contingent on satisfactory progress through each year of study. Progress will be formally assessed each Spring as follows: Year One Preliminary Screening (Early/Mid Spring) The preliminary screening will consist of a formal evaluation of the scholarly work completed from the time of admission through the completion of 18 credits of coursework (counting work in progress in a current term). This screening must occur during the second semester of study, so that a decision can be made prior to admission and graduate assistantship decisions for the upcoming Fall. An advisory committee consisting of a minimum of 3 members (the student’s advisor, Director of Graduate Study, and at least one other) will conduct the ﬁrst year preliminary screening review. The intent is to determine relatively early in students’ academic careers whether or not they display the high quality of academic achievement necessary to pursue and successfully complete the doctoral degree. Excellent students will be  UNC Greensboro 2023-24 University Catalog 707 encouraged to continue in the program. Students who do not meet the requirements will be strongly urged through counseling by their advisory/ dissertation committee to complete the M.S. degree level and pursue other intellectual/career avenues. In order to progress to Year 2, all members of the student’s preliminary screening committee must review all criteria and conﬁrm satisfactory progress in the preliminary evaluation. Year Two Research Competence (End of Spring Semester) Students will be expected to be actively engaged in research from the beginning of their studies in Year 1. In Year 2, students will be expected to complete a comprehensive research project by the end of their second year of study. This project should encompass all aspects of the research process, including the following: • Conception and design of the project • Acquisition and reduction of the data • Analysis and interpretation of the data • Written summary of the work (e.g. Submission ready manuscript) • Oral presentation of the work To progress to Year 3, the student’s M.S./Ph.D. advisory committee must approve the work. Year Three Comprehensive Examination When the student has completed a minimum of three-quarters of the coursework (60 credits) contained in the program of study and completed the research skill requirements, they are then eligible to take the comprehensive examinations. Each doctoral student is required to pass the doctoral preliminary examinations which consist of both a written and oral examination, per the guidelines of the Graduate School and the Department of Kinesiology.

Morrison, Department Chair Lauren A. Haldeman, Director of Undergraduate Studies Jigna M. Dharod, Graduate Program Director About The Department of Nutrition offers course instruction, research experience, and ﬁeldwork opportunities. The curriculum is designed to train students in the three areas of focus listed below. • Human Nutrition and Dietetics —develops and educates students to work as agricultural extension agents; dietitians in hospitals, long- term care facilities and public health programs; nutrition education specialists; sports nutrition; consultants and entrepreneurs. The Human Nutrition and Dietetics concentration is the Didactic Program in Dietetics and meets the academic requirements of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (AND). Students completing this concentration meet academic requirements to be eligible to apply to a dietetic internship or preprofessional practice program. The Didactic Program of Dietetics is currently granted approval status by the Accreditation Council for Education in Nutrition and Dietetics (ACEND) of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (AND). • Nutrition Science —prepares students for entry into medical, dental, chiropractic or graduate school; trains students for research and development in the biomedical, biotechnical, and pharmaceutical industries. • Nutrition and Wellness —provides instruction and experience in the basic nutritional sciences, community nutrition, public health education, and kinesiology, enabling graduates to work in a variety of settings such as voluntary and community health organizations, health care, government, education, and the ﬁtness industry. This concentration also prepares students for graduate training in nutrition, public health education, and kinesiology. Graduate Study The Department of Nutrition graduate programs leading to the Master of Science (M.S.) and the Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degrees in nutrition both offer specializations in community nutrition and nutrition education, human/clinical nutrition, and cellular and molecular nutrition. Background courses in general chemistry, organic chemistry, biochemistry, mammalian physiology, and general nutrition are required for all degree programs. Upon entry, a Plan of Study is developed by students and their advisors or Advisory Committees to develop strengths in the area of interest the student has chosen. Accreditation The accreditation agency of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics is the Accreditation Council for Education in Nutrition and Dietetics (ACEND).  ACEND is recognized by the US Department of Education as a Title IV Gatekeeper.  This recognition afﬁrms that ACEND meets national standards and is a reliable authority on the quality of nutrition and dietetics education programs.  ACEND is also a member of the Association of Specialized and Professional Accreditors (ASPA) and abides by its code of good practice.

Criteria for Progression in the Major New ﬁrst year and transfer students are required to have a minimum 2.50 cumulative GPA to be admitted to the B.S. in Nutrition. Additionally, all continuing students must maintain a cumulative GPA of at least 2.50 throughout the completion of the Nutrition major. Students that change their Nutrition major or concentration during the academic year will be held to the minimum 2.50 GPA requirement. If the GPA drops below 2.50, students will be contacted in writing by the Undergraduate Program Director indicating that they have dropped below the threshold and will have one semester to increase the cumulative GPA to at least 2.50. If this does not happen, the student will be dropped from the Nutrition major  UNC Greensboro 2023-24 University Catalog 711 the following semester. Notiﬁcations to students will be made at the beginning of each fall and spring semester. A student must earn a grade of C (a C- is not acceptable) or better in all required NTR and related area courses to graduate in each of the three concentrations offered by the department. Furthermore, students must earn a C or better in prerequisite courses to enroll in speciﬁc upper-level courses (see course listings). A student may not receive credit for any NTR course by special examination. No NTR course or related area course for which a grade of C (a C- is not acceptable) or better is required for the major may be taken more than twice. Students who receive a grade below C, which includes a C-, twice in the same NTR course or related area course for which a grade of C or better is required for the major will be dropped from the major. Suggested Academic Workload Guidelines The faculty of the Department of Nutrition recognizes that many of its students must hold jobs to support college expenses. The faculty wishes to emphasize that academic excellence and scholastic achievement usually require a signiﬁcant investment of time in study and out- of-class projects. To provide guidance to students in planning their academic and work schedules, the faculty have endorsed the following recommendations: 1. In general, students should plan to devote between 2–3 hours outside of class for each hour spent in class. Thus, students with a 15 credit hour course load should schedule between 30–45 hours weekly for completing outside-of-class reading, study, and homework assignments. 2. Students who are employed more than 5–10 credits each week should consider reducing their course loads (semester hours), depending upon their study habits, learning abilities, and course work requirements. Overall Requirements • 120 credit hours, to include at least 36 credits at or above the 300 course level • Students must earn grades of C (2.0) or better in all major and related area required courses.

At UNCG, we are uniquely located to understand and explore these experiences. Greensboro is a refugee and immigrant resettlement hub: 13% of our population is foreign born (U.S. Census Bureau, 2018) and over 150 languages are spoken here. Additionally, Greensboro’s history of refugee and im/migrant resettlement has precipitated the creation of a vast infrastructure of refugee and im/migrant support networks, service providers, and organizations. In this minor, students will learn about the reasons for and experiences of forced migration and resettlement. Students will also engage with forcibly displaced individuals in our local community. Additionally, because of the presence of the Center for New North Carolinians on campus, students will take a practicum that will allow them to immerse themselves in refugee/migrant/asylum seeker support history, networks, and service-providers as well as engage in the work of promoting access and integration for refugees through community engaged learning, service, and research.

Peace and Conflict Studies, M.A. The M.A. in Peace and Conflict Studies is dedicated to providing high quality, professional training in multiple conflict intervention and prevention skills such as mediation, negotiation, facilitation, restorative practices, violence prevention, and collaborative problem solving. Students engage in community-based learning through a variety of courses to build practice, intervention, and research skills. The program focuses on pragmatic approaches to solving personal and social problems in a variety of social settings. Students are exposed to an array of techniques and strategies to achieve nonviolent solutions to conflict that arises in diverse family, organizational and community environments. The program promotes a systemic and critical perspective to the challenges facing individuals, families, organizations and communities in both a global and local analytical and practical perspective. With an interdisciplinary commitment to social justice and human rights, we train professionals to seek collaborative, constructive and conciliatory methods for resolving human conflict. Our goal is to mold reflective conflict professionals—practitioners with a critical understanding of theory, research and a range of methods, local and global perspectives, and an appreciation of diversity, peace development and social justice. The M.A. in Peace and Conflict Studies requires completion of 33 credit hours for the online Transformative Peace and Conflict Concentration and 30 credit hours for the campus-based Sustainable Peace and Justice Concentration. The Sustainable Peace and Justice Concentration offers both Practicum and Thesis options (see the Requirements section for more details on the concentrations).  Flexible concentrations allow students of all ages, job requirements, technology, and delivery needs to participate in the learning process. Online classes are asynchronous and do not require speciﬁc meeting times.  Face-to-face courses are typically offered in the evenings to meet the needs and schedules of working adults.

The Department of Public Health Education offers the Bachelor of Science (B.S.) degree in Public Health Education major with a concentration in Community Health Education or Health Studies (an online degree program). Both concentrations provide a foundation in the core areas of public health including: social and behavioral sciences, epidemiology, public health statistics, and health policy and administration. Only students in the Community Health Education concentration are eligible candidates for national credentialing as a Certiﬁed Health Education Specialist (CHES.). The Health Studies Online concentration is an online option available for second-degree seeking students looking for a non-professional degree to complement their current professional or career experiences. Community Health Education Concentration Increasing national interest in health and health promotion attracts students to the undergraduate degree program in Community Health Education. The concentration provides ﬁeld experiences in public and private agencies as part of the professional preparation program. Students are prepared to design and implement health promotion programs in the community. Graduates have careers in national, state, and local health agencies, health and human services organizations, and business and industry; and many continue on into graduate study. Health Studies Online Concentration The program leading to the Bachelor of Science in Public Health, Health Studies Online concentration, is designed to prepare individuals for positions in health-related ﬁelds and provide a base for graduate study. The Health Studies Online concentration will allow time and location bound students to complete an undergraduate degree without relocating to the UNC Greensboro campus. Our graduates, like other graduates in general education programs, are competitive in the job market for careers in administration, education, health sciences, human relations, and public service, and in other governmental, community-based and/or nonproﬁt settings. Students requesting admission to the Health Studies Online concentration may apply to the major only after earning a prior degree (A.A., A.S., B.A., B.S., or equivalent; an A.A.S. is not an equivalent option) from an accredited college or university and completion of courses that satisfy General Education requirements. Criteria for Admission to the Public Health Education Major Before the registration window opens, students must declare their major as Public Health Education (PUBH) through the University Registrar's Ofﬁce, and select a concentration, either Community Health Education (COHE) or Health Studies Online (HEST). Only students who have their major ofﬁcially declared as PUBH major will be permitted to register in upper level public health education (HEA) courses, typically completed in the junior and senior years. Additionally, only students who have selected either COHE or HEST as their concentration, will be allowed to register for concentration-restricted course sections.  UNC Greensboro 2023-24 University Catalog 721 Note: All HEST concentration prerequisite courses may not be online. Therefore, meeting with an admissions counselor or advisor prior to transferring or changing your major concentration is necessary to understand how to complete concentration program requirements. Health Studies Online Admission Requirements Minimum Criteria for Admission to the Health Studies Online Concentration Prior degree Students requesting admission to the Health Studies Online concentration may declare this concentration only after earning a prior degree (A.A., A.S., B.A., B.S., or equivalent; A.A.S. does not count as an equivalent) from an accredited college or university and completion of courses that satisfy General Education requirements. Overall Requirements • 120 credit hours, to include at least 36 credits at or above the 300 course level. • Students must continue to maintain the cumulative GPA requirement of 2.50 to progress and graduate.

Jay Poole, Graduate Program Director, Joint Ph.D. Mission of the Department of Social Work The mission of the UNC Greensboro B.S.W. Program is to prepare culturally competent, ethical social workers who embody the core social work values as described in the National Association of Social Workers Code of Ethics. These core values include; service, social justice, the dignity and worth of the person, the importance of human relationship, integrity, competence, human rights, and scientiﬁc inquiry. Human rights and social justice are key components of what social workers do, and an important part of our mission is for students to apply these values and ethics in their social work practice. We prepare students to engage with others at the intersection of culture, race, gender, and class, to promote healthy functioning for individuals, families, groups, organizations, and communities. Our goal is the transformation of personal history into professional identity through mentoring, teaching, research, and our signature pedagogy – ﬁeld education. Faculty promote social, economic, and environmental justice through research, engaged scholarship, and collaboration with social services agencies. Learning takes place within an intentional, collaborative community that respects and embraces diversity and promotes inclusion Department Goals 1. Prepare graduate and undergraduate students to become competent, engaged social workers who demonstrate the knowledge, ethics, values, and skills of the profession. 2. Prepare graduates to work effectively with diverse and marginalized people. 3. Prepare students to facilitate inclusion at all systems levels— individual, family, group, organization, community, and policy. 4. Create a learning community that respects diversity and encourages the exploration of difference. 5. Increase engagement with social service agencies and other community institutions to promote social change. 6. Conduct change-oriented research to promote social and economic justice. Mission of the Bachelor of Social Work Program Our mission is to prepare competent, ethical social workers who will become the backbone of the social services delivery system in the Piedmont Triad and beyond. We prepare students to engage with others at the intersection of person and environment, race, gender, and class, in order to promote healthy functioning for individuals, families, groups, and communities. Our goal is the transformation of personal history into professional identity through mentoring, teaching, our signature pedagogy—ﬁeld education, research, and engaged scholarship. Learning takes place within an intentional, collaborative community that respects and embraces diversity and promotes inclusion.

Social Work, M.S.W., offered jointly with North Carolina A&T State University Program Goals Four program goals reflect the mission of the Joint Master of Social Work program in three complementary areas: the provision of a quality master’s level social work curriculum, service to the people of North Carolina, and scholarship. • Create an intentional learning community which recognizes, understands, supports, and honors diversity and difference, especially for students from oppressed groups. • Prepare graduates to engage in culturally-competent, effective, ethical, multiculturally-competent clinical practice. • Collaborate with consumers and colleagues to promote social and economic justice and improve the lives of the people of North Carolina and beyond. • Conduct and disseminate community-engaged scholarship which contributes to the knowledge base of the profession and promotes effective social work practice.  UNC Greensboro 2023-24 University Catalog 733 Curriculum Plan The Joint Master of Social Work program with the Department of Sociology and Social Work at NCA&TSU offers two-year and advanced standing program options. Students in the full-time two-year option complete 60 credit hours of course work. The advanced standing option requires 42 credit hours in one calendar year. All students must complete courses in the prescribed sequence to progress successfully to completion of the degree program. The curriculum design of the program provides students with a theoretical and applied education in social work to enhance and promote multicultural clinical social work practice. The program is organized to insure that all students, as advanced social work practitioners, will be prepared to independently engage in clinical social work practice with individuals, families, and small groups, and to work effectively within organizations and communities around issues of social justice and access to services. Generalist Year Curriculum In the generalist curriculum, students complete 30 credits of course work. Students complete courses in social work and social welfare policy, social work practice and human diversity, social work practice with individuals, social work practice with groups, and family theory and intervention. Students also complete courses on foundations of clinical social work practice, social work and social justice, social work research methods, and two generalist ﬁeld instruction and seminar courses. The purpose of the generalist course work is to prepare students for the specialization curriculum. Specialization Curriculum In the specialization curriculum, students complete an additional 30 credits of course work. Students complete two courses in advanced social work clinical practice, an advanced research course, and a course on organizational practice from a clinical perspective. They also complete two semesters of advanced ﬁeld instruction and ﬁeld seminar. Students also complete two graduate-level electives, which must be approved by the student’s educational advisor. Advanced Standing Option Advanced Standing students have been admitted into Advanced Standing with a B.S.W. degree and complete 42 credits of graduate course work to obtain the M.S.W. They begin their graduate course work in the summer taking 12 credits of course work. This course work builds a content bridge between B.S.W. course work and the specialization year curriculum of the M.S.W. program. School Social Work Licensure Students intending to become licensed at the graduate level for school social work by the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction need to complete the Licensure Program, which has been developed with the School of Education.

Physical and/or Emotional Problems That Do Not Respond to Treatment Students in any program can be dismissed from the School of Nursing for physical and/or emotional problems that do not respond to appropriate treatment and/or counseling within a reasonable period of time. Investigation and Evaluation When faculty members identify a student who presents physical and/or emotional problems that do not respond to appropriate treatment and/ or counseling, they immediately suspend the student from the course. Faculty notify the Course Chair and/or Program Director within the School of Nursing. Upon determination by the faculty, Course Chair and Program Director, that the physical and/or emotional problems warrant dismissal from the School of Nursing, the Dean will be notiﬁed. The Dean, in consultation with the faculty, and upon review of the documentation, will make a decision regarding recommending dismissal of the student from the School of Nursing. The Dean of Nursing will send to the Dean of the Graduate School written notiﬁcation of the recommendation. If the Dean of Nursing recommends dismissal from the School of Nursing, the Dean of the Graduate School will notify the student. Should the student wish to appeal the decision, the student will submit a written request to the School of Nursing Appeals Committee. The Dean of Nursing will provide to the committee the accumulated correspondence or documentation related to the issue. A request for an appeal should occur within seven working days of written notiﬁcation of the decision from the Dean of the Graduate School. Hearing Process The chairman of the School of Nursing Appeals Committee will thereafter notify the student, the faculty member, Course Chair and Program Director as to the time and place for a hearing to determine whether the physical and/or emotional problems warrant dismissal. The Committee will hold a closed hearing within ten days at which time the faculty member, Course Chair and Program Director will be present and will provide documentation and other oral or written evidence regarding the incident. The student will be present and will be given an opportunity to provide documentation and other oral or written evidence regarding the problem. The student will be allowed an advocate/support person at the hearing; however, the support cannot speak. Following the factual presentation, the Committee will convene in executive session to determine whether the problem warrants dismissal from the School. The Committee shall make its recommendation in writing to the Dean of Nursing and forward pertinent documentation. The Committee may recommend dismissal from the School of Nursing major, or reinstatement in the program. Post Hearing Process The Dean of Nursing may accept, reject, or modify the Committee’s recommendation. The Dean’s decision will be made after review of the minutes of the hearing and report to the Committee. If the Dean of Nursing accepts the Committee’s recommendation to dismiss the student from the School of Nursing, the recommendation will be forwarded to the Dean of the Graduate School who will notify the student. The Dean of Nursing will notify the faculty member(s) as to the determination. A student who has been dismissed may reapply for admission to the School of Nursing. Policy on Unsafe Practice The nursing faculty of the School of Nursing have an academic, legal, and ethical responsibility to prepare graduates who are competent as well as to protect the public and health care community from unsafe nursing practice. It is within this context that students can be disciplined or dismissed from the School of Nursing for practice or behavior which threatens or has the potential to threaten the safety of a client, a family member or substitute familial person, another student, a faculty member, or other health care provider. Student Awareness All students are expected to be familiar with the principles of safe practice and are expected to perform in accordance with these requirements. Within courses, counseling and advising processes, and other instructional forums, students will be provided with the opportunity to discuss the policy and its implications. Deﬁnition An unsafe practice is deﬁned as: An act or behavior of the type which violates the North Carolina Nursing Practice Act, Article 9 of Chapter 90 of the North Carolina General Statutes (NCGS 90-171.37; 90-171.44). An act or behavior of the type which violates the Code of Ethics for Nurses of the American Nurses Association. An act or behavior which threatens or has the potential to threaten the physical, emotional, mental or environmental safety of the client, a family  746 School of Nursing member or substitute familial person, another student, a faculty member or other health care provider. For prelicensure undergraduate students this is deﬁned as any Reckless Behavior or repeated At Risk Behavior as identiﬁed on the NCBON Just Culture Nursing Student Practice Event Evaluation Tool (SPEET).  See https://www.ncbon.com/vdownloads/just- culture/just-culture-speet.pdf). An act or behavior (commission or omission) which constitutes nursing practice for which a student is not authorized or educated at the time of the incident. Investigation and Evaluation of an Unsafe Practice When an incident occurs which a faculty member believes may constitute an unsafe practice, he/she shall immediately notify the student and instruct the student to leave the clinical setting. The faculty member will notify the Course Chair and/or Program Director within the School of Nursing. The Course Chair and/or Program Director will investigate the incident within three working days to determine whether there are grounds for believing that an unsafe practice has occurred. If the incident is minor, the faculty member, in consultation with the person named above, may require remedial work or instruction for the student. If the incident is major, the Course Chair or Program Director, in consultation with the involved faculty member, will review the student's clinical performance evaluations, academic record, and potential for successful completion of the major in nursing. Based upon this careful and deliberate review, a decision to reprimand the student,  require withdrawal from the clinical course, or to recommend dismissal of the student from the School of Nursing will be made. The Dean will be informed of the decision and will send written notiﬁcation of the decision to the student via certiﬁed mail. Should the student wish to appeal the decision, the student will submit a written request to the School of Nursing Appeals Committee. The Program Director or course faculty will provide the accumulated correspondence or documentation related to the issue to the Committee. A request for an appeal should occur within seven working days of receipt of written notiﬁcation of the decision from the Dean. Hearing Process The Chair of the School of Nursing Appeals Committee will thereafter notify the student, the faculty member, Course Chair and Program Director as to the time and place for a hearing. The Committee will hold a closed hearing within ten working days of receipt of the request for an appeal, at which time the faculty member, may be present and will provide documentation and other oral or written evidence regarding the incident. The student will be allowed an advocate/ support person at the hearing; however, the support person cannot speak at the hearing and cannot be an attorney. Following the factual presentation, the Committee will convene in executive session to review the actions taken against the student for unsafe practice and to make a recommendation regarding the resolution of the incident. The Committee will base its recommendation on the evidence presented at the hearing. The Committee shall make its recommendation in writing to the Dean and forward pertinent documentation. The Committee may recommend the following remedies: support for the action taken, remedial work or instruction, a reprimand, withdrawal from the course, or  dismissal from the School of Nursing. Post Hearing Process The Dean may accept or reject the Committee’s recommendation. The Dean’s decision will be made after review of the minutes of the hearing and report of the Committee. The Dean will notify the student and the faculty member(s) as to the decision made.  Dismissal from the School of Nursing does not constitute dismissal from the University.  A student who has been dismissed may reapply for admission to the School of Nursing. Appeal of Policies If a student wishes to appeal a policy in the School of Nursing, the student should complete a “Student Appeal Request.” The Student Appeals Committee hears student appeals. Students may obtain the request form and discuss the appeals process with the Chair of the Committee, the Associate Dean for Academic Programs, or the Director of the student's Program. Readmission After Withdrawal Any student who is withdrawn or withdraws from the program must apply for readmission through normal admission procedures.

UNC Greensboro 2023-24 University Catalog 747 Nursing, B.S.N. The School of Nursing offers an undergraduate program leading to the Bachelor of Science in Nursing Degree. The ﬁrst two years of study are in general education, basic sciences, and humanities. The majority of the work in the junior and senior years is in nursing. A Veterans’ Access Program (VAP) is also offered, leading to the Bachelor of Science in Nursing degree. The School also offers a Registered Nurse to B.S.N. program, where licensed RNs prepared at the diploma or associate degree level can earn a Bachelor of Science in Nursing. The Nursing B.S.N., R.N. to B.S.N. concentration is available in traditional as well as online formats. Accreditation The pre-licensure Bachelor of Science in Nursing program offered by the School of Nursing is approved by the North Carolina Board of Nursing. The Bachelor of Science in Nursing program at UNC Greensboro is accredited by the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education (CCNE) (http://www.ccneaccreditation.org). Admissions and Policies Nursing B.S.N. Admission and Progression Admission for Pre-licensure Students Students must be formally admitted to the School of Nursing which is an upper division major. Only students who have formal, written acceptance into the School will be permitted to register in nursing courses and complete work for the major. Admission should normally be sought during the sophomore year. The application deadline is February 1 of each year. Applications are obtained from the Advising Center in the School of Nursing. Transcripts from all post-secondary schools attended must be submitted with the application. Technical Standards for Admission, Academic Progression, and Graduation Consistent with its mission and philosophy, the School of Nursing at The University of North Carolina at Greensboro (UNC Greensboro) is committed to providing educational opportunities to facilitate student learning. The School of Nursing programs prepare students to think critically and practice nursing competently and compassionately in rapidly changing practice environments. All efforts are designed to build nursing knowledge, enhance nursing practice and patient safety, foster professional integrity, and ultimately improve the health outcomes of individuals, families, groups, and communities across the continuum of care. Certain functional abilities also are essential for the delivery of safe, effective nursing care. The UNC Greensboro faculty have determined that the technical standards listed below must be met by all students for admission, progression and graduation from the undergraduate and graduate nursing programs, with or without reasonable accommodations. If a student is unable to meet these technical standards, the student will not be allowed admission, or to remain enrolled in or to graduate from the nursing program. In addition to classroom learning, clinical learning occurs throughout the program and involves considerations that are not present for classroom accommodations (such as patient safety and clinical facility requirements).  Any applicant or student who seeks accommodations prior to or immediately after enrolling in the nursing programs must also request an assessment of the types of reasonable accommodations needed for all the types of clinical experiences required in the nursing program. An individual must be able to independently, with or without reasonable accommodation, meet the following technical standards of general abilities and those speciﬁcally of: a) communication; b) motor; c) observation; d) cognitive, conceptual, and quantitative; e) behavioral and interpersonal attributes; and f) professional conduct.  Individuals unable to meet these technical standards, with or without reasonable accommodation, will not be able to complete the program and are encouraged to pursue other careers. General abilities: The student is expected to possess functional use of the senses of vision, touch, hearing, and smell so that data received by the senses may be integrated, analyzed and synthesized in a consistent and accurate manner.  A student must also possess the ability to perceive pain, pressure, temperature, position, vibration, and movement, which are important to the student’s ability to gather signiﬁcant information needed to effectively assess and evaluate patients.  A student must be able to respond promptly to urgent situations that may occur during clinical activities including, but not limited to, performing basic life support, paging the rapid response team, operating equipment at the bedside, and asking another nurse for assistance and must not hinder the ability of other members of the health care team to provide prompt patient care. Communication abilities: The student must communicate effectively and sensitively both verbally and non-verbally to elicit information and to translate that information to others with whom they interact. The student must have the ability to read, write, comprehend, and speak the English language to facilitate communication with patients, family members, and other members of the health care team. In addition, the student must be able to review and maintain accurate patient records, present information in a safe, professional and logical manner, and provide patient education and counseling to effectively care for patients and their families. The student must possess verbal and written communication skills that permit effective communication with instructors, clinical staff, and other students in both the classroom, laboratory, and clinical settings. Motor abilities: The student must be able to perform gross and ﬁne motor movements with sufﬁcient coordination needed to perform complete physical examinations utilizing the techniques of inspection, palpation, percussion, auscultation, and other diagnostic maneuvers. The student must develop the psychomotor skills reasonably needed to perform or assist with procedures, treatments, administration of medication, management and operation of diagnostic and therapeutic medical equipment, and such maneuvers required to assist with patient care activities such as lifting, wheelchair guidance, and ambulation. The student must possess the manual dexterity that is required for certain activities, such as drawing up solutions into a syringe. The student must have sufﬁcient levels of neuromuscular control and eye- hand coordination, as well as possess the physical and mental stamina to meet the demands associated with extended periods of sitting, standing, moving, and physical exertion required for satisfactory and safe performance in the clinical and classroom settings. These include, but are not limited to, performing CPR, and completing a typical nurse’s clinical assignment, including working a 12-hour shift. Observation abilities: The student must have sufﬁcient capacity to make accurate visual observations and learn from demonstrations in  748 Nursing, B.S.N. the clinical, classroom, and laboratory settings. Likewise, the student must have sufﬁcient capacity to perform health assessments and interventions; observe diagnostic specimens; and obtain information from digital, analog, and waveform representations of physiologic phenomena to determine a patient’s condition. In addition, the student must be able to accurately document these observations. Cognitive, Conceptual, and Quantitative abilities: The student must be able to develop and reﬁne problem-solving skills that are critical to practice as a competent nurse. Problem-solving includes the abilities to measure, calculate, reason, analyze, and synthesize objective and subjective data, and to make sound decisions, often in a time urgent environment, that reflect consistent and thoughtful deliberation and sound clinical judgment. The student must have sufﬁcient capacity to comprehend three-dimensional and spatial relationships. Each student must demonstrate mastery of these skills and possess the ability to incorporate new information from peers, instructors, preceptors, and the health-related literature to formulate sound judgment in patient assessment, care planning, intervention, and evaluation of care. Behavioral and Interpersonal attributes: Personal comfort with and acceptance of the role of a nurse functioning under supervision of a clinical instructor or preceptor is essential for a nursing student.  The student must possess the emotional health required for full utilization of the student’s intellectual abilities; the exercise of good judgment; the prompt completion of all responsibilities in the classroom and clinical settings; and the development of mature, sensitive, and effective relationships with patients and other members of the health care team. Each student must be able to exercise stable, sound judgment and to successfully complete patient assessments and nursing interventions in a timely manner. Understanding that all student interactions with patients, instructors, preceptors, and other members of the health care team are conﬁdential and are not shared with others is critical in establishing ethical and professional nursing practice. The ability to establish rapport and maintain sensitive, interpersonal relationships with individuals, families, and groups from a variety of social, emotional, cultural and intellectual backgrounds is critical for nursing practice. The student must be able to adapt to changing environments; display flexibility; accept and integrate constructive criticism given in the classroom and clinical settings; effectively interact in the clinical setting with other members of the health care team; and learn to function cooperatively and efﬁciently in the face of uncertainties inherent in clinical practice. Professional Conduct: The student must be willing to learn and abide by professional standards of practice. They must possess attributes that include compassion, empathy, altruism, integrity, honesty, responsibility, and tolerance. The student must be able to engage in patient care delivery in all settings and be able to deliver care to all patient populations including, but not limited to, children, adolescents, adults, individuals with disabilities, medically compromised patients, and vulnerable adults. The student also must be able to adapt to and function effectively in stressful situations that may occur in the classroom and in the clinical settings, including emergency situations.  The student may encounter and must be able to navigate multiple stressors while in the nursing program, including, but are not limited to, personal, patient care, family, faculty/peer, and or program related. UNC Greensboro’s mission is to provide optimal educational opportunities for all students, including those with disabilities. The University recognizes that reasonable accommodations may be necessary for students with disabilities to have access to campus programs and facilities. In general, University policy calls for accommodations to be made on an individualized and flexible basis for qualiﬁed students with disabilities. Students are responsible for seeking assistance at the University and making their needs known. Any applicant or student with questions or concerns about their ability to meet these technical standards, with or without accommodations, or who would like to arrange reasonable accommodations, should contact the Ofﬁce of Accessibility Resources & Services (https://ods.uncg.edu/) at (336) 334-5440 or oars@uncg.edu. Process for Requesting Reasonable Accommodation Optional Disclosure Prior to Admission Candidates for admission to the School of Nursing are not required, prior to admission, to disclose that they will require reasonable accommodations in order to meet the Technical Standards. Candidates may, however, voluntarily disclose prior to admission the fact that they will require reasonable accommodations to meet the Technical Standards. If the student elects voluntarily disclosure before admission, this information will not be considered by the university on the question of whether the student should be admitted. Instead, assuming the student is admitted, the information will be used after admission to determine whether the student will be provided any requested accommodations pursuant to the process described below. Disclosure After Admission If the student requests a reasonable accommodation in a timely fashion, an interactive process involving the student, Associate Dean for Academic Programs in the School of Nursing, relevant faculty members and the Ofﬁce of Accessibility Resources and Services will be commenced to determine what, if any, accommodations will be provided to the student. In all cases where a student has requested an accommodation in a timely fashion, the student must cooperate with the Associate Dean for Academic Programs in the School of Nursing and Ofﬁce of Accessibility Resources and Services in an interactive process to determine whether the student is qualiﬁed for accommodations and what, if any, accommodations will be provided pursuant to applicable laws. The Ofﬁce of Accessibility Resources and Services will assist the student in coordinating documentation and evaluation of the student, which may include asking the student to provide requested documentation of a qualiﬁed disability. No accommodation will be offered that would jeopardize the safety of patients or clients or the university student. No accommodation will be offered that would fundamentally alter or substantially compromise these technical standards or any other academic standards deemed essential to graduation by the university, including all course work, ﬁeldwork, clinical practica, and internships. Minimum Criteria for Admission Students may not enroll in required nursing courses without being admitted to the School. Application for admission is possible while students are still completing the prerequisite courses, but unconditional admission cannot be granted until admission criteria have been successfully completed. Admission to the university does not guarantee acceptance into the nursing major. Various health care agencies in Piedmont North Carolina cooperate with the School of Nursing in providing clinical learning experiences for students. The size of each incoming junior class is determined by the availability of these clinical resources. Therefore, it is impossible to assure space for every student who meets the criteria.

For students in the pre-licensure program, results must be submitted by June 1, prior to enrolling in the required 300-level nursing courses. The university has contracted with Certiphi.com (http://Certiphi.com) to perform this service. The cost is to be paid by the student. The results will be kept in the student’s School of Nursing ﬁle and will be destroyed upon graduation, withdrawal, or termination from the program. The Associate Dean for Academic Affairs will receive the results of the criminal background check of each undergraduate student. The School will not use this information in any way except to verify to clinical agencies that students have been subjected to the background check and to release a copy of the information to the agency, if requested. Students must sign two release forms (copies available in the Student Affairs Ofﬁce), which will authorize the release of the information to the clinical agency, if requested. Directions on obtaining the background check are available in the Student Affairs Ofﬁce. This criminal background check does not replace the one that will be done by the N.C. Board of Nursing prior to initial licensure as a registered nurse (see item #5). 7. Beginning July 1, 2009, all students must have a negative urine drug screen by a National Institute of Drug Abuse (NIDA)- approved lab prior to clinical activity. The screen must test for the following drugs: AMP (amphetamine), BAR (barbiturates), BZO (benzodiazepines), COC (cocaine), THC (marijuana), MTD (methadone), mAMP (methamphetamine), MDMA (ecstasy), OPI (opiate), PCP (Phencyclidine), PPX (propoxyphene), ALC (alcohol), and OXY (oxycodone). In some cases, such as when results are inconclusive, it will be necessary to repeat the test. Note: Many labs in North Carolina are not NIDA-approved. The agency has contracted with Corporate Screening to do the drug screens, although tests from other NIDA-approved labs are acceptable if they screen for all the required drugs. Directions on obtaining the drug screens from Corporate Screening are available in the Student Affairs Ofﬁce. 8. If none of the clinical agencies under contract with the School of Nursing are willing to allow a student to participate in clinical activities at that agency because of information gathered from urine drug screen testing, background check, or other pre-clinical screening required by clinical agencies, the student will be required to withdraw from the nursing program. Policies for Nurses Unsafe Practice Policy The nursing faculty of the School of Nursing have an academic, legal, and ethical responsibility to prepare graduates who are competent as well as to protect the public and health care community from unsafe nursing practice. It is within this context that students can be disciplined or dismissed from the School of Nursing for practice or behavior which threatens or has the potential to threaten the safety of a client, a family member or substitute familial person, another student, a faculty member, or other health care provider. Student Awareness All students are expected to be familiar with the principles of safe practice and are expected to perform in accordance with these requirements. Within courses, counseling and advising processes, and other instructional forums, students will be provided with the opportunity to discuss the policy and its implications. Deﬁnition An unsafe practice is deﬁned as listed below. 1. An act or behavior of the type which violates the North Carolina Nursing Practice Act, Article 9 of Chapter 90 of the North Carolina General Statutes (NCGS §90-171.37; §90-171.44) 2. An act or behavior of the type which violates the Code of Ethics for Nurses of the American Nurses’ Association 3. An act or behavior which threatens or has the potential to threaten the physical, emotional, mental or environmental safety of the client, a family member or substitute familial person, another student, a faculty member or other health care provider 4. An act of behavior (commission or omission) which constitutes nursing practice for which a student is not authorized or educated at the time of the incident. Investigation and Evaluation of an Unsafe Practice When an incident occurs which a faculty member believes may constitutes an unsafe practice, he/she shall immediately notify the student and instruct the student to leave the clinical setting. The faculty member will notify the Course Chair and/or Program Director within the School of Nursing. The Course Chair and/or Program Director will investigate the incident within three working days to determine whether there are grounds for believing that an unsafe practice has occurred. If the incident is minor,  752 Nursing, B.S.N. the faculty member, in consultation with the Course Chair or Program Director may require remedial work or instruction for the student. If the incident is major, the Course Chair or Program Director, in consultation with the involved faculty member, will review the student’s clinical performance evaluations, academic record, and potential for successful completion of the major in nursing. Based upon this careful and deliberate review, a decision to reprimand the student, require withdrawal from the clinical course, or to dismiss the student from the School will be made. The Dean will be informed of the decision and will send written notiﬁcation of the decision to the student via certiﬁed mail. Should the student wish to appeal the decision, the student will submit a written request to the School of Nursing Appeals Committee. The Program Director will provide the accumulated correspondence or documentation related to the issue to the committee. A request for an appeal should occur within seven (7) working days of receipt of written notiﬁcation of the decision from the Dean. Hearing Process The Chair of the School of Nursing Appeals Committee will thereafter notify the student, the faculty member, Course Chair, and Program Director as to the time and place for a hearing. The Committee will hold a closed hearing within ten (10) working days of receipt of the request for an appeal, at which time the faculty member, Course Chair, and Program Director may be present and provide documentation and other oral or written evidence regarding the incident. The student may be present and will be given an opportunity to provide documentation and other oral or written evidence regarding the incident. The student will be allowed an advocate/support person at the hearing; however, the support person cannot be an attorney, and will not be permitted to speak. Following the factual presentation, the Committee will convene in executive session to review the actions taken against the student for unsafe practice and to make a recommendation regarding the resolution of the incident. The Committee will base its recommendation on the evidence presented at the hearing. The Committee shall make its recommendation in writing to the Dean and forward pertinent documentation. The Committee may recommend the following remedies: support for the action taken, remedial work or instruction, a reprimand, withdrawal from the course, or dismissal from the School of Nursing. Post-Hearing Process The Dean may accept or reject the Committee’s recommendation. The Dean’s decision will be made after review of the minutes of the hearing and report of the Committee. The Dean will notify the student and the faculty member(s) as to the decision made. Dismissal from the School of Nursing does not constitute dismissal from the university. A student who has been dismissed may reapply for admission to the School of Nursing. Dismissal of Students Who Present Physical or Emotional Problems That Do Not Respond to Treatment Policy Students can be dismissed from the School of Nursing for Physical and/ or emotional problems that do not respond to appropriate treatment and/ or counseling within a reasonable period of time. Investigation and Evaluation When faculty members identify a student that presents physical and/or emotional problems that do not respond to appropriate treatment and/ or counseling, they immediately suspend the student from the course. Faculty notify the Course Chair and/or Program Director within the School of Nursing. Upon determination by the faculty, Course Chair, and Program Director, that the physical and/or emotional problems warrant dismissal from the School of Nursing, the Dean will be notiﬁed. The Dean, in consultation with the faculty, and upon review of the documentation, will make a decision regarding dismissal of the student from the School of Nursing. The Dean will send written notiﬁcation of the decision to the student. Should the student wish to appeal the decision the student will submit a written request to the School of Nursing Appeals Committee. The Dean will provide the accumulated correspondence or documentation related to the issue to the committee. A request for an appeal should occur within seven (7) working days of written notiﬁcation of the decision from the Dean. Hearing Process The Chair of the School of Nursing Appeals Committee will thereafter notify the student, the faculty member, the Course Chair, and Program Director as to the time and place for a hearing to determine whether the physical and/or emotional problems warrant dismissal. The committee will hold a closed hearing within ten (10) working days at which time the faculty member, Course Chair, and Program Director will be present and will provide documentation and other oral or written evidence regarding the incident. The student will be present and will be given opportunity to provide documentation and other oral or written evidence regarding the problem. The student will be allowed an advocate/support person at the hearing; however, the support person cannot be an attorney, and will not be permitted to speak. Following the factual presentation, the Committee will convene in executive session to determine whether the problem warrants dismissal from the School. The Committee shall make its recommendation in writing to the Dean and forward pertinent documentation. The Committee may recommend dismissal from the School of Nursing major, or reinstatement in the program. Post-Hearing Process The Dean may accept, reject, or modify the Committee’s recommendation. The Dean’s decision will be made after review of the minutes of the hearing and report of the Committee. The Dean will notify the student and the faculty member(s) as to the determination. Dismissal from the School of Nursing does not constitute dismissal from the university. A student who has been dismissed may reapply for admission to the School of Nursing.  UNC Greensboro 2023-24 University Catalog 753 Nursing B.S.N. Under the Veteran's Access Program (VAP) Veteran’s Access Program in Nursing The UNC Greensboro VAP will have three tracks as detailed below. • One for the non-RN veteran student who wishes to accelerate the program. • One for the non-RN veteran student who wishes to receive military experience credit for some courses but not accelerate their nursing program. • One for the RN veteran student in the RN to B.S.N. concentration. All VAP students will need 120 credit hours to graduate. This may be comprised of transfer credit, credit earned at UNC Greensboro, or credit by competency testing and/or exam; however, 31 credits of course work must be taken at UNC Greensboro. UNC Greensboro grants a minimum of 6 credits for military experience and basic training. Credit granted is variable based on military occupational specialties and years of service. VAP students’ Joint Services transcript will be assessed individually to determine speciﬁc General Education course requirements, using American Council for Education (ACE) principles. This process will be used to determine learning gaps for each VAP student. A learning gap analysis will determine the speciﬁc courses for which the veteran may be eligible to receive credit through transfer credit evaluation, competency skills testing, and standardized examination. Overall VAP requirements for the Nursing major are detailed with the information for the general Nursing major.

Admission to Lloyd International Honors College Admission to Lloyd International Honors College is required to take courses offered by the Honors College and to participate in many of Lloyd International Honors College’s programs. Admission processes for Global Honors and Disciplinary Honors are detailed on the website. Minimum requirements to be considered for admission depend on the applicant’s status at the time of application. Admission to the college is competitive. Meeting minimum requirements does not guarantee admission. Incoming First-Year Students To be eligible to apply for admission to Lloyd International Honors College, the prospective student must meet minimum test score or high school GPA requirements set by the college, which can be found on the college’s website. Transfer Students Students transferring to UNC Greensboro with no more than two semesters at another institution may be eligible to apply for Global Honors. The prospective student must meet minimum test score or high school GPA requirements, which can be found on the college's website. Students transferring to UNC Greensboro after any number of semesters at another institution may be eligible for Disciplinary Honors. An aggregate transferable GPA of 3.30 is required from all former institutions. Transcripts to verify the aggregate GPA should be submitted to Undergraduate Admissions from all prior institutions attended. Students must also have at least one semester at UNC Greensboro with at least a 3.30 GPA before applying for Disciplinary Honors. Continuing UNC Greensboro Students Continuing UNC Greensboro students must have at least a 3.30 UNC Greensboro GPA to apply to either Global or Disciplinary Honors. They must meet with an Honors academic advisor to receive the application for current students. If applying for Global Honors, they must meet with an Honors academic advisor to review their options and receive the application for current students. If applying for Disciplinary Honors, students may apply directly on the LIHC website. Lloyd International Honors College Petition Policy Incoming ﬁrst-year UNC Greensboro students who do not meet one of the speciﬁed criteria for admission to Lloyd International Honors College may petition the dean for admission. When the candidate makes a persuasive case that he or she is fully capable of succeeding in Global Honors, the dean may admit the student. A student admitted through the petition process will be expected to meet all of the requirements for maintaining good standing in the Global Honors Program, and is subject to the same rules as other Honors College students, including the conditions requiring suspension or removal from the college. Programs Lloyd International Honors College offers two enhanced academic programs—the Global Honors Program and the Disciplinary Honors Program. Students who complete both the Global Honors Program and the Disciplinary Honors Program are recognized for their high achievement and awarded Full University Honors. Global Honors The Global Honors Program is designed to complement and enrich the university’s Minerva’s Academic Curriculum (MAC) for students in any major. Students who complete the Global Honors Program may replace regular MAC courses with Honors courses, may take Honors courses in a variety of modes, will complete the beginning level of language competency in a second language, and will design an individualized course of academic, professional, and personal development by participating in selected, Honors-approved Global Honors Experiences. Examples of Global Honors Experiences include study abroad, additional Honors courses, additional language courses, leadership development workshops, undergraduate research presentations, and attending Honors Programming.  Global Honors students take ownership over their own education and development while learning the essential skills to engage with others creatively and compassionately. Disciplinary Honors The Disciplinary Honors Program allows students in all majors to do Honors work in their majors or in upper-division interdisciplinary studies. Through Disciplinary Honors, students have the opportunity to study topics in depth and to do research under the supervision of a faculty member, thus giving themselves a competitive advantage when applying to graduate school or beginning a career. Community College Memoranda of Understanding • Alamance Community College (NC) • Durham Technical Community College (NC) • Guilford Technical Community College (NC)  766 Lloyd International Honors College • Haywood Community College (NC) • Robeson Community College (NC) • Southwestern Community College (NC) Students who graduate from the ﬁve listed community colleges with a college-transferrable degree [e.g., Associates in Arts (A.A.) or Associates in Science (A.S.)] may earn the Designation of Honors Graduate from Lloyd International Honors College at UNC Greensboro.

Students entering under this memorandum must maintain good standing and fulﬁll other requirements that the college applies to all Honors students. Courses Honors courses are taught by faculty members who are among the best at UNC Greensboro, who are deeply engaged with their disciplines, and who are dedicated to helping students achieve their greatest potential. Honors courses are typically small (15–25 students) and foster discussion, collaboration, and mutual discovery among students and faculty. Typically, Honors courses fulﬁll a variety of university and departmental requirements. There are several types of Honors courses: • Honors Seminars in which students explore interdisciplinary topics in greater breadth and/or depth than in typical courses while fulﬁlling Minerva's Academic Curriculum (MAC) requirements; • Honors sections of regular UNC Greensboro courses that allow students to explore other topics or continue to do Honors work in their major; • Honors Tutorials and Honors Independent Study through which students either individually or in small groups work with a faculty member on a topic of mutual interest; • The Senior Honors Project in which a student, under the guidance of a professor, produces a research project. • Disciplinary Honors Contract courses that allow students to enhance a regular undergraduate course and receive Honors credit for that course. Note: Honors Contract courses can be used only to fulﬁll Disciplinary Honors Program requirements; they cannot be used to fulﬁll Global Honors Program requirements. The same contract course cannot be used to fulﬁll the requirements for both Global and Disciplinary Honors. Contract courses must be at or above the 300-level to qualify for Disciplinary Honors, unless otherwise speciﬁed by the department. • Embedded Honors courses. These are special sections of regular UNC Greensboro courses that meet in lecture with a larger non- Honors version of the course. While Honors students in embedded Honors courses share lectures with their fellow non-Honors students, they have a different syllabus and may have different texts, other readings, and additional assignments. Embedded Honors courses require the approval of Lloyd International Honors College and the associated department or school. The variety of Honors courses, and particularly the chance to customize one’s curriculum through tutorials and independent studies, means that students have considerable control over their own education. Moreover, many of the advanced Honors courses, such as the Senior Honors Project, allow students to do original and sophisticated work, and are an excellent preparation for graduate school, professional training, and other post-graduation endeavors. Honors Academic Advising Lloyd International Honors College staff offers advanced group and individual advising to help students discover the best ways to take advantage of Honors at UNC Greensboro, and to make sure that students have the needed support and encouragement along the way to completing their degrees. A variety of informal information sessions and colloquia are also provided for students interested in talking about particular topics of interest such as study abroad, internships, or graduate school. Extra-Curricular Activities and Student Involvement Lloyd International Honors College sponsors a number of extracurricular events. Among these events are orientations for both Global Honors and Disciplinary Honors, the annual Honors Symposium, the Artist-in- Residence program, Food for Thought, Monday Play!, Bon Voyage, Bon Retour, lectures and special performances, ﬁeld trips, and community service projects. Honors students can participate in the Honors Ambassadors program, and the Gray Hall Fellows program. Honors Abroad Experiences In collaboration with UNC Greensboro’s Ofﬁce of International Programs, Lloyd International Honors College from time to time offers Honors Abroad Experiences for Honors students interested in an honors- enhanced study abroad experience at select locations. To be considered, students must: 1. submit an Honors Abroad application to Lloyd International Honors College and 2. be accepted for study abroad at an appropriate location by the International Programs Center. Accepted students are given an all-expenses paid (except for food) week, or more, at a foreign location with a UNC Greensboro faculty member. Students accepted into an Honors Abroad Experience enroll in HSS 310, a three-credit Honors course, in addition to whatever courses are taken at the host institution. HSS 310 requires that students meet with a UNC Greensboro faculty member before traveling abroad to discuss readings about their trip and the character of the country they are about to visit. Students and the UNC Greensboro faculty member then spend  UNC Greensboro 2023-24 University Catalog 767 approximately a week exploring and taking in cultural activities abroad associated with a particular academic topic. During their semester, students travel and engage in a variety of writing assignments that allow them to reflect on their experience. Finally, students gather for a colloquium upon returning to UNC Greensboro the following semester. Honors Awards Lloyd International Honors College administers awards that recognize high achievement. At the Honors Convocation every spring, the college’s Honors Council bestows the Provost Student Excellence Award, the university’s highest academic undergraduate honor, on outstanding seniors. At the end of each semester, the Honors College honors students who have successfully completed one of Lloyd International Honors College's programs at a cording ceremony or banquet. Honors Housing North and South Spencer Honors Residence Halls and Gray Honors Residence Hall are housing options for Honors students and are required for incoming freshmen living on campus. Incoming Honors ﬁrst-year students may apply to live in North and South Spencer Residence Halls upon their acceptance into the Global Honors program. Gray Honors Residence Hall serves sophomore through senior Honors students who are interested in Undergraduate Research and/or community engagement.  Current Honors students who desire to live in the Honors Residence Halls must be in good standing (have a 3.30 UNC Greensboro GPA at time of application) and are required to remain in good standing and to meet other requirements that can be found on the Honors College website in order to continue living in the hall.

IPC’s work supports UNC Greensboro’s diversity, equity, and inclusion goals. Education Abroad A UNC Greensboro student in good standing may engage in a summer, semester, or academic year opportunity abroad in several ways. Faculty-Led Programs UNC Greensboro professors regularly develop and lead student group programs overseas for course credit. Over the past few years, groups have gone to such countries as Costa Rica, Italy, Greece, Spain, United Kingdom, and Tanzania, among many others. Faculty lead students abroad on interculturally immersive short-term programs during Winter Break, Spring Break, and over summer. Exchange Programs UNC Greensboro students may study abroad for a semester or year at one of our partner universities while still paying UNC Greensboro tuition and utilizing all their ﬁnancial aid. This makes exchange programs one of the most accessible avenues for studying abroad. These long- standing exchange partnerships provide reliable support abroad since UNC Greensboro reciprocally hosts exchange students from these partner universities to come and study at UNC Greensboro. Programs are available for every major in over 40 countries around the world. Virtual Global Programs UNC Greensboro students may take advantage of virtual international experiences to learn a language, access subject areas as taught by partner institutions, or even engage in an internship with an organization abroad. These affordable, credit-bearing and non-credit bearing opportunities allow students to engage internationally regardless of where they are located. Additional Education Abroad Programs Students can also take advantage of dozens of additional approved summer, semester, and year-long study, intern, and research abroad opportunities offered by UNC Greensboro partner universities, afﬁliated education abroad providers, and faculty members. These non-exchange education abroad options also offer a cost effective means to engage in global activities. Note that participation in non-UNC Greensboro-afﬁliated education abroad programs requires approval from the International Programs Center in order for transfer credit to be awarded, for non-credit curricular requirements to be satisﬁed, or for UNC Greensboro ﬁnancial aid or scholarships to apply. International Student and Scholar Services UNC Greensboro is home to more than 700 international students and scholars who represent more than 70 countries around the world. Speciﬁc services and advocacy are provided by the International Student and Scholar Services (ISSS) for international students (both degree- seeking and short-term incoming exchange), and visiting scholars, including faculty, researchers, and observers. IPC provides services from the time of initial contact through the student or scholar’s entire experience at the university. IPC offers continued support to international students up to 36 months beyond graduation for those who participate in the Optional Practical or Academic Training post-completion employment beneﬁt associated with the F and J visa status. Support for select scholarships The International Programs Center (IPC) successfully supports study abroad students applying for and receiving the Benjamin Gilman International Scholarship. IPC also provides information and support to current students and recent graduates applying for the U.S. Fulbright Student Program and the Barry Goldwater Scholarships. Opportunities include undergraduate and graduate study, research, and teaching — often in other countries. IPC works with faculty and units across campus to provide advice and feedback to candidates at all stages of the application process. System-Wide Initiative: Baden- Württemberg North Carolina (BW/NC) Exchange Program On behalf of the UNC System, IPC is responsible for the administration of the Baden-Württemberg state-to-state Exchange Program (https:// sites.google.com/uncg.edu/bwnc-exchange/home/). We established this study abroad exchange partnership between North Carolina’s 15 university campuses and the 9 Baden-Württemberg universities in Germany. The BW/NC Exchange Program allows students to continue enrollment on their home campus while studying abroad at an exchange institution in Baden-Württemberg or North Carolina for no additional tuition. Committees All IPC activities are carefully supervised and supported by the following committees:  UNC Greensboro 2023-24 University Catalog 775 • IPC Advisory Committee • Study Abroad Committee • Discretionary Funds Committee • University-Afﬁliated International Travel Committee • Global Leadership (GLP) Steering Committee  776 Preprofessional Programs Preprofessional Programs UNC Greensboro offers courses required for admission to medical, dental, pharmacy, veterinary, occupational therapy or physical therapy schools, or as needed for entrance into law school. A suggested two-year pre- engineering curriculum prepares students to transfer to schools with engineering programs. At UNC Greensboro, Preprofessional Programs are not majors in which degrees can be earned nor do they prescribe courses required for graduation. Rather, these “Programs” are meant to identify students with an interest in applying to a post-graduate professional school in the health sciences, engineering, or law. Therefore, students who choose to designate an interest track must still select an academic area of study as their major. Students elect to become associated with the Preprofessional Programs by selecting an interest track which matches their future career aspirations. Making this election through a form provided on the SpartanConnect website then allows UNC Greensboro to provide targeted advising and support to assist students in preparing for application to their post-graduate schools of choice. The election form can be accessed via the following link: https://spartancentral.uncg.edu/forms/ pre-professional-interest-tracks (https://spartancentral.uncg.edu/forms/ pre-professional-interest-tracks/) Students interested in designating a preprofessional interest track are urged to seek advising early in their academic careers. Health Sciences UNC Greensboro provides individualized, one-on-one support for students planning for a career in a health-related ﬁeld through the Health Careers Advisory Committee, a group of faculty and professional advisors who are trained and experienced in helping students successfully navigate the path towards creating a competitive application to these graduate programs after completing a degree at UNC Greensboro. The committee can meet with prospective students before they arrive at UNC Greensboro, they provide assistance while students are at UNC Greensboro, and then also guide UNC Greensboro alumni for as long as needed. We offer the rigorous courses required for admission to medical, dental, pharmacy, veterinary, physician assistant, optometry, occupational therapy or physical therapy schools, and most other health-related professional schools.

Students with these declared interest tracks will be assigned to a member of this committee to assist in planning their program of study as their secondary advisor. They will also be automatically enrolled in the (ORG) Pre-Professional Programs group in Canvas, which will provide resources and communication about upcoming events, opportunities, and deadlines. The admission requirements vary slightly among the various schools and programs. For speciﬁc information students should review the websites of the speciﬁc professional schools to which they are most interested in applying. Other sources of information are current databases of programs such as the Medical School Admission Requirements and Admission Requirements of American Dental Schools. Most professional training programs require a core of courses (""prerequisites"") that must be completed before admission. They can be successfully incorporated into almost any major. The choice of major does not signiﬁcantly affect the student’s probability of admission to a given professional graduate school. Students should give consideration to any major that they ﬁnd interesting and in which they excel. Nearly all professional schools require completion of a bachelor’s degree, although some Pharmacy and Physical Therapy schools may allow enrollment of students without bachelor's degrees. The achievement of outstanding academic credentials should not be accomplished at the expense of sacriﬁcing extracurricular activities. Professional programs prefer students who have actively pursued their interests, especially in the areas of leadership, service to under- served populations, and clinical or health-related experiences. (Physician  UNC Greensboro 2023-24 University Catalog 777 assistant and veterinary medicine schools require speciﬁed hours of clinical care experiences for competitive application. Medical schools prioritize applicants who have paid medical experience such as CNA, CMA, EMT, phlebotomist, etc.) In addition to course work, virtually all professional schools require some form of standardized test prior to consideration of a student’s admission application. These tests are usually taken in the spring before application is made to the professional school centralized application service in early summer. Medical schools require the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT), dental schools the Dental Admission Test (DAT), and veterinary medicine schools and physician assistant schools the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) Aptitude Test, optometry schools require the OAT, etc. Applications to professional schools are made a year before expected matriculation, usually between May and September. This means that the course work included on the standardized entrance test must be completed by the end of the junior year of college in order to move straight from college to professional schools the following August without a “gap” year. With this being said, students should be aware that completing requirements to apply after the senior year would allow them to spread out the required courses, pursue minors or second majors, or study abroad, which may increase the success of students in admissions to professional schools. In the application year, early application to professional schools (by August 1) is strongly recommended, as interviews and acceptances go ﬁrst to the earliest applicants. (Physician assistant schools start in June, August or January, so their application cycle begins in April.) Professional school applications are made directly to Centralized Application Services for each type of graduate program. The American Medical College Application Service (AMCAS) is the agent for allopathic medical schools, the American Association of Dental Schools Application Service (AADSAS) is the agent for many dental schools, the American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine (AACOMAS) is the agent for osteopathic medical schools, the Central Application Service for Physician Assistants (CASPA) is the agent for physician assistant schools and the Veterinary Medical College Application Service (VMCAS) is the agent for most veterinary medical schools. Application information is available from those services directly and through the Canvas Pre- professional Programs group resources. Medical, dental, PA and vet schools not subscribing to the centralized application service must be contacted individually. Students interested in other post college health careers such as Optometry, Podiatric Medicine, Chiropractic Medicine, Genetic Counseling, etc. are encouraged to declare a Pre-medicine interest track as well, to have access to the resources and Health Careers Advisory Committee for assistance in planning their programs of study.

Pre Veterinary Medicine Recommended Courses Veterinary school course requirements are considerably more extensive than those for medical or dental schools. In addition to specifying all of the above courses in mathematics, chemistry, and biology, these programs typically require or recommend more courses in animal science, general microbiology, animal nutrition, and possibly some business courses. Several hundred hours of work experience with animals or in a veterinarian’s practice is required. Students interested in veterinary school should make contact with the school and with the advisory committee at an early stage of their undergraduate careers, to discuss how to meet these requirements.

Like most universities, UNC Greensboro does not have a Prelaw major. Students who plan to attend law school may select their major from any academically rigorous ﬁeld. However, since law schools seek to admit students who can think, speak, and write at the highest levels of competency, students (regardless of major) should take courses that develop skills in critical, creative, and reflective thinking as well as clear and cogent writing and speaking. To obtain these skills, it is especially useful to take courses in the areas of Philosophical, Religious, and Ethical Principles (GPR) and Reasoning and Discourse (GRD). Courses in these areas are offered by many departments, including Anthropology, Communication Studies, English, History, Philosophy, Political Science, Religious Studies, and Sociology. In addition, Freshman Seminars, Honors, and Residential College courses are helpful. Students should also be sure to develop computer skills. Students interested in Prelaw should consult one of the Prelaw advisors from the above list in addition to their major advisors. Pre Occupational Therapy Advisors Stuart J.

Administered by the Residential Colleges Ofﬁce in the University Teaching and Learning Commons, the Residential Colleges are curricular and co-curricular academic communities designed around high-impact educational practices and populated by ﬁrst- and second-year students who live together in a residence hall and take a common core of general education, capstone, and other interdisciplinary courses around a particular concept such as social justice and contemporary media literacies (Ashby), professionalism and team-based learning (Grogan), or sustainability and hands-on research (Strong). Having been a part of the UNC Greensboro academic community since 1970, these innovative living-learning environments offer a full slate of general education courses in Minerva's Academic Curriculum (MAC) in addition to a series of core courses that speak to and engage with a key concept that frames the curricular and co-curricular programming in each RC. The Residential College model is founded on the idea that students who engage with faculty, take classes together in small communities, and connect their intellectual and academic experiences to their lives and communities have a better chance at thriving in college, while learning to explore new ideas and asking how that knowledge might beneﬁt others. Open to ﬁrst- and second-year students in every major on campus, the Residential Colleges help students develop a strong foundation in critical inquiry, writing, speaking, and problem solving, as well as personal and social responsibility. Rich in traditions, the Residential Colleges each maintain a series of annual signature events and unique academic and social programs. The following unique curricular foci and signature pedagogies/methodologies integrate the courses and learning experiences within each RC: Ashby Residential College in Mary Foust Hall Curricular Focus: Social Justice and Contemporary Media Literacies Signature Pedagogy/Methodology: Multi-literacies and Genre Work Grogan Residential College in Grogan Hall Curricular Focus: Professionalism Signature Pedagogy/Methodology: Project- and Team-Based Learning Strong Residential College in Guilford Hall Curricular Focus: Sustainability Signature Pedagogy/Methodology: Field Work and Hands-on Research Vision Drawing on our rich histories, the Residential Colleges offer students innovative and interdisciplinary courses, close working relationships with faculty, and leadership opportunities that encourage intellectual curiosity, personal development, and civic engagement. Additionally, the Residential Colleges provide opportunities for faculty to reﬁne their teaching praxis through supported development in High-Impact Educational Practices (HIPs). Requirements Admission into one of the Residential Colleges is required for enrollment in courses and participation in co-curricular and social programs offered by the Residential Colleges. To apply for admission, incoming students respond to Residential College-speciﬁc questions on their university application. Once enrolled in the Residential Colleges, students may earn graduation cords and the Ashby, Grogan, or Strong Residential College Scholar transcript notation and be eligible for awards and scholarships by fulﬁlling the following minimum requirements: 1. Fulﬁllment of RC-speciﬁc (curricular, co-curricular, and leadership) participation expectations, including 4 semesters of residency in a Residential College. 2. Completion of 6–9 credits of Core RCO courses. 3. Completion of a 3-credit Capstone RCO course, including presentation of an undergraduate research and/or creative inquiry project. 4. Endorsement of the Program Chair of the Residential College.

Ashby Residential College in Mary Foust is an inclusive, two-year program that offers a unique living and learning environment for a co-ed student community of approximately 120 freshmen and sophomores with a limited number of Upper-Class Mentor participants. Ashby is a small college but with immediate and complete access to the diverse facilities, programs, and departments of a larger university. Ashby provides a setting that encourages innovative study, small classes, unity of academic and social experiences, and close student-faculty contacts. A Residential College Coordinator, who serves on the faculty, resides in the hall. Other faculty members have ofﬁces in the residence hall. Students and faculty serve on governing committees and participate together in special events within the community. Every semester, the Ashby curriculum includes approximately eighteen courses taught by faculty from departments across campus. These courses meet UNC Greensboro general education requirements as well as requirements for a variety of majors. All students are asked to participate in one of the ARC multidisciplinary core courses, which represent four to ﬁve integrated courses from the Ashby curriculum, and to choose another class from the other curricular offerings, which represent a wide range of academic subjects. These seminars, along with varied types of independent study and community service work, make up approximately six hours of a student’s semester course load. The remaining semester hours are taken within the greater university. Ashby students are not only full members of UNC Greensboro, but are also encouraged to participate in the life of the university.

Brady, October 4, 2012 Approved by the UNC Board of Governors, October 11, 2012 Reafﬁrmed by the UNCG Board of Trustees, March 24, 2022 Approved by the UNC Board of Governors, July 20, 2022 UNC Greensboro will redeﬁne the public research university for the 21st century as an inclusive, collaborative, and responsive institution making a difference in the lives of students and the communities it serves. UNCG is ... • A learner-centered, accessible, and inclusive community fostering intellectual inquiry to prepare students for meaningful lives and engaged citizenship; • An institution offering classes on campus, off campus, and online for degree-seeking students and life-long learners; • A research university where collaborative scholarship and creative activity enhance quality of life across the life-span; • A source of innovation and leadership meeting social, economic, and environmental challenges in the Piedmont Triad, North Carolina, and beyond; and • A global university integrating intercultural and international experiences and perspectives into learning, discovery, and service.  786 Admission to the University ADMISSION TO THE UNIVERSITY • Undergraduate Admissions (p. 786) • Graduate Admissions (p. 796) Undergraduate Admissions Students who participate in North Carolina’s Reverse Transfer Program and earn an Associate of Arts or Associate of Science will have fulﬁlled the university’s lower-division general education requirements (Minerva's Academic Curriculum), but not intermediate-level general education requirements like the College of Arts and Sciences’ foreign language requirement. Also, due to degree requirements in some majors, additional lower-division courses at UNC Greensboro may be required beyond the general education courses and pre-major courses taken at the community college. UNC Greensboro seeks prospective students with ability, motivation, and the intellectual potential to meet UNC Greensboro standards of performance. UNC Greensboro’s admission decision is based on an evaluation of the applicant’s secondary school record and/ or college record as shown in the subsections of the Undergraduate Admissions portion of the University Catalog. The University of North Carolina at Greensboro is committed to equality of educational opportunity and does not discriminate against applicants, students, or employees based on race, color, national origin, religion, sex, age, or disability. This commitment is in keeping with Title IX of the Educational Amendments of 1972 and Section 504, Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the ADA of 1990, and other applicable federal and state laws. The Afﬁrmative Action Ofﬁcer is responsible for coordinating compliance and investigating complaints. Auditors Auditing a course is the privilege of being present in the classroom when space is available. No credit is involved, no examinations are required, and no grades are reported. Attendance, preparation, and participation in classroom discussion and activities are at the discretion of the department and the instructor. Online courses cannot be audited. Registration for audited courses begins the ﬁrst day of classes for a given semester and ends on the last day of late registration. Visiting Auditors (Persons Not Requiring a Record of Enrollment) A person not currently enrolled at UNC Greensboro who desires to audit a course and who does not require a record of enrollment should secure a Visiting Auditor form from the Ofﬁce of Undergraduate Admissions. This can be found on our website at https://admissions.uncg.edu/apply/ visiting (https://admissions.uncg.edu/apply/visiting/). A Visiting Auditor may audit courses for a fee of $125. If the Visiting Auditor is aged 65 years or older and is a resident of or lives in North Carolina, there is no fee for auditing a course. Auditors must secure permission from the course instructor before submitting their completed form to the University Registrar's Ofﬁce. Only courses approved by academic departments are open to auditors. Visiting auditors are permitted in lecture courses when space is available with the written approval of the department head or the instructor teaching the course. Persons may register as visiting auditors beginning the ﬁrst day of classes for any given semester. Criminal Background Checks Pursuant to University of North Carolina system policy 700.5.1[R], UNC Greensboro will perform background checks on either (a) all applicants offered admission, or (b) all applicants offered admission who indicate their intent to attend, before the applicant may matriculate, as follows: • The UNC Suspension and Expulsion Data Base • The National Student Clearinghouse UNC Greensboro (UNCG) will perform criminal background checks on applicants being considered for admission or already admitted if the application and supporting materials contain one or more of the following security triggers: 1. the application or supporting material contains inconsistent answers that have not been satisfactorily explained; 2. the applicant answers one or more of the four criminal background/ discipline questions afﬁrmatively or submits subsequent information indicating (1) pending criminal charges, (2) acceptance of responsibility for a crime, (3) criminal convictions or (4) school disciplinary action, unless the afﬁrmative answer or supporting material relates to a school disciplinary action that resulted from an offense that is remote in time or was insubstantial; 3. the application omits one or more answers without an acceptable explanation; 4. any other reason sufﬁcient to UNC Greensboro. Students who give a positive response to one of the security triggers are required to submit a background investigation report by an approved third party vendor and a written letter of explanation describing the circumstances related to the positive responses. Admissions reviews this information, and in some cases, the ﬁle will move to the Dean of Students Ofﬁce or to an internal university review committee for a ﬁnal decision. If a decision to deny admission is rendered, a student has the right to appeal. Domestic Applicants with International Credentials U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents (LPR), pending LPR (with approval notice), DACA, temporary protected status (TPS), political asylees, refugees, undocumented individuals, are considered domestic applicants and should apply through the Ofﬁce of Undergraduate Admissions (https://admissions.uncg.edu). Domestic applicants whose transcripts are from a non-U.S. institution must have a course-by-course evaluation conducted on all international secondary education (freshmen only) and/or any international college/ university attended.  Visit http://www.naces.org for the list of evaluation companies UNC Greensboro accepts or refer to a list of preferred providers at: https://intladmissions.uncg.edu/international-credentials (https://intladmissions.uncg.edu/international-credentials/). The purpose of the credential evaluation report is to verify academic credentials and ensure course credit and U.S. grade equivalency are  UNC Greensboro 2023-24 University Catalog 787 completed accurately.  This also eliminates the need to obtain ofﬁcial, translated transcripts to be sent to UNC Greensboro. Applicants who have studied in the U.S. must request ofﬁcial transcripts be sent from each institution directly to the Ofﬁce of Undergraduate Admissions. In some instances, course descriptions and/or syllabi may be needed in order to determine course transferability from U.S. and non-U.S. institutions to UNC Greensboro.  Course descriptions and/or syllabi must be in English and issued by the sending institution(s) to the Transfer Articulation Division of the University Registrar’s Ofﬁce. English Language Proﬁciency UNC Greensboro Accepts the Following English Language Proﬁciency scores for direct entry into its Baccalaureate Programs: • IBT TOEFL 79 [TOEFL iBT Special Home Edition (https://www.ets.org/ s/cv/toefl/at-home (https://www.ets.org/s/cv/toefl/at-home/)) score report also accepted, same score] • IELTS 6.5 [IELTS Indicator (https://www.ieltsindicator.com) also accepted, same band score] • Duolingo English Test DET 105 (https://englishtest.duolingo.com/ applicants (https://englishtest.duolingo.com/applicants/)) • ELS 112 score report • Kaplan International Higher Intermediate Level • PTE Academic 53 • Cambridge C1 Advanced (https://www.cambridgeenglish.org/exams- and-tests/advanced (https://www.cambridgeenglish.org/exams-and- tests/advanced/)) • ISE II (B2) (https://www.trinitycollege.com/qualiﬁcations/english- language/ISE (https://www.trinitycollege.com/qualiﬁcations/english- language/ISE/)): Distinction in all 4 Skill Levels • GTEC 1204 (Advanced or CBT Type) • iTEP 3.8 • American Language Academy (ALA) (https://ala.edu) and ALA-Sky Campus Level 5 Certiﬁcate The English Language Proﬁciency score is waived by one of the following: • You are a graduate of a U.S. high school or academy. • You are a graduate of an International School/Academy or IB school where the entire curriculum is taught entirely in English. • An English Composition grade of C minimum from an accredited U.S. college/university. • Obtained the highest level of English language training certiﬁcate from a qualiﬁed English Academic Program (US or non-US) – submitted for review and approval by the International Admissions Ofﬁce. • You have graduated from a school or are from: Australia, Canada (English curriculum only), Bahamas, Cayman Islands, Ireland, New Zealand, South Africa, United Kingdom. • Achieved INTERLINK (https://interlink.edu/uncg (https:// interlink.edu/uncg/)) Level 6 (on campus) or INTERLINK Level 12 (online program).

The Ofﬁce of Undergraduate Admissions reserves the right to request additional information regarding an applicant’s activities and responses to questions pursuant to University of North Carolina system policy 700.5.1[R]. If additional information cannot be collected, the application may be denied. Freshmen For the purposes of admission, a freshman is deﬁned as a ﬁrst-time undergraduate who is a degree-seeking student with no prior post- secondary experience (after graduating high school). Summer is not considered a degree-seeking term. All students should hold a high school diploma or its equivalent. Minimum Course Requirements Minimum Course Requirements. The following courses must be completed at the high school level or the summer following graduation, although courses may be completed at an earlier time (e.g., middle school).  788 Undergraduate Admissions English: four course units emphasizing grammar, composition, and literature Mathematics: four course units in any of the following combinations: • Algebra I, algebra II, geometry, and one unit beyond algebra II; or • Algebra I, algebra II, and two units beyond algebra II; or • Common core math I, II, and III, and one unit beyond common core math III; or • Integrated math I, II, III, and one unit beyond integrated math III; or • NC Math 1, 2, 3, and one unit beyond NC Math 3 identiﬁed as meeting the 4th level mathematics requirement for admission to UNC System institutions.

Second Language: two course units of a language other than English Social Studies: two course units, including one unit in U.S. history* *An applicant who does not have the unit in U.S. history may be admitted on the condition that at least three credit hours in that subject be passed by the end of the sophomore (second) year at UNC Greensboro. Minimum Admissions Requirements Prospective freshmen candidates for admission must meet UNC system minimum requirements, as follows: 1. A composite ACT score of 19 or combined SAT (mathematics and evidence-based reading and writing) of 1010 and/or 2. A minimum weighted high school GPA of 2.5 Additional requirements beyond acceptance into UNC Greensboro may be required for particular baccalaureate program majors. Chancellor Exceptions Admissions criteria are uniformly applied, with a limited number of exceptions allowed by UNC System Policy. Speciﬁcally, a limited number (no more than 1% of the admitted class) of exceptions to the UNC ﬁrst- year admissions requirements are made through a policy known as Chancellor Exceptions. The maximum number of chancellor’s exceptions is limited to one percent of the total number of applicants accepted as ﬁrst-time undergraduates each year. A chancellor’s exception may be applied to the SAT/ACT minimum requirement or the high school GPA minimum requirement. Special Considerations for Students Missing Minimum Course Requirements (MCRs) Per UNC System Policy, each campus shall establish policies describing the admission of students requiring special consideration with regard to MCRs. Such students would not otherwise be eligible for admission at the institution, and further evaluation of their records is necessary. Any student admitted under special consideration must show demonstrable promise for academic success at the institution. Institutions may waive some minimum course requirements for applicants who have superior academic records in high school, as measured by grades, rank in class, test scores, or the rigor of courses taken, or who demonstrate special talents. These applicants must have completed the eleventh grade and met virtually all of the minimum course requirements as well as the requirements for high school graduation. Special Considerations for MCRs are reviewed by the Admissions Appeal Committee, which is a faculty-driven body designed to review, consider, and make recommendations on university admissions appeals for undergraduate students who are denied initial admission to the university.  This committee consists of six or more faculty and reviews student cases to complete recommendations on admission. High School Visiting Students UNC Greensboro will accept for enrollment in certain university courses high school juniors and seniors and who have the formal endorsement of and permission from a high school counselor and parent/guardian. Enrollment is limited to one course per semester. The cost per course for which university credit is given is the same as for other students taking fewer than nine hours. Credit earned before completion of high school may be applicable to a degree program at UNC Greensboro when the student has met all requirements for high school graduation and satisﬁed the requirements for admission as a freshman. Individuals wishing to enroll in university courses as indicated should proceed according to the policies of the high schools, and the high schools should contact the UNC Greensboro Ofﬁce of Admissions for further information. Graduates of Cooperative Innovative High Schools (Early College) Students graduating from a North Carolina Cooperative Innovative High School (CIHS) with an associate’s degree will have the option of being evaluated for admission as a freshman or as a transfer student. The student will remain identiﬁed as a freshmen by student type for purposes such as housing. UNC Greensboro will provide written information to the student regarding the different admission requirements that accompany each option and any other relevant information that may be helpful to the student when considering which option to select.  The choice of freshman or transfer admissions consideration is only pursuant to admissions requirements. Graduates of North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics (NCSSM) UNC Greensboro will offer freshman admission to any applicant attending the residential program at NCSSM. Such offer of admission shall be contingent upon the applicant: 1.  Successfully completing all NCSSM graduation requirements and remaining enrolled and in good standing at NCSSM through the time of the student’s graduation.

Transfer Credit Transfer Articulation Services Located in the University Registrar’s Ofﬁce, this unit enters transfer credit course work into the student’s ofﬁcial record. Also, in association with university faculty, this unit is responsible for determining how postsecondary-level courses and credits transfer to UNC Greensboro, applying admission-level transfer credit regulations, and enforcing the provisions of the North Carolina Comprehensive Articulation Agreement. Students with questions about transfer credit are encouraged to contact Transfer Articulation Services at transfercredit@uncg.edu. Transfer Credit Policies and Limits Institutional Accreditation UNC Greensboro is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges. The primary service area for the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC) includes Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia. SACSCOC does accept applications from international institutions that can meet its accreditation standards. The accreditation standards of this Commission require member institutions to analyze credit accepted for transfer in terms of level, content, quality, comparability, and degree program relevance; therefore, course credit for undergraduate degree-seeking students that originates from other SACSCOC member institutions can be readily evaluated by Transfer Articulation Services. These requirements are consistent with the Accrediting Commission for Community and Junior Colleges (ACCJC) Western Association of Schools and Colleges, Higher Learning Commission (HLC), Middle States Commission on Higher Education (MSCHE), New England Commission of Higher Education (NECHE), Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities (NWCCU), Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC), and WASC Senior College and University Commission (WSCUC). UNC Greensboro recognizes the accreditation standards of these agencies; course credit originating from any institution accredited by these agencies for undergraduate degree-seeking students can be readily evaluated by Transfer Articulation Services.  792 Undergraduate Admissions Professional School Admissions Admission to the university does not constitute selection into any of the professional schools. Minimum Transferable Grade Transfer credit to be awarded is determined by the quality and quantity of the student’s previous college work. Course work completed with a grade of C-, D+, D, or D- will not transfer. Transfer courses are evaluated on a course-by-course basis. Transfer Credit Limit The sum total of transfer credit from two-year college(s), that may be applied toward an undergraduate degree may not exceed 64 credit hours. Repeated Courses The university’s Repeated Course Policy applies to transfer credit. In the case of duplicate transfer credit, only the ﬁrst instance in which credit can be awarded will remain on the UNC Greensboro academic record. Programs and Articulation Agreements Comprehensive Articulation Agreement The North Carolina General Assembly, the Board of Governors of the University of North Carolina, and the State Board of Community Colleges are committed to the simpliﬁcation of transfer of credits for students and thus facilitating their educational progress as they pursue associate or baccalaureate degrees within and among public post-secondary institutions in North Carolina. The Comprehensive Articulation Agreement (CAA) is a statewide agreement governing the transfer of credits between NC community colleges and public universities in North Carolina, and has as its objective the smooth transfer of students, providing certain assurances to the transferring student by identifying community college courses that are appropriate for transfer as electives, and specifying courses that will satisfy pre-major and general education requirements. The CAA establishes the procedures governing the transfer of credits for students who transfer from a North Carolina Community College to a constituent institution of the University of North Carolina. To be eligible for the transfer of credits under the CAA, the student must graduate from the community college with an Associate in Arts (AA) or Associate in Science (AS) degree and have an overall Grade Point Average (GPA) of at least 2.0 on a 4.0 scale and a grade of “C” or better in all CAA courses. Students who do not complete the degree are eligible to transfer credits on a course-by-course basis. Students ofﬁcially enrolled in an AA or AS program at a North Carolina community college prior to Fall Semester 2014 are subject to the conditions and protections contained in the CAA in place at the time of their initial enrollment as long as they have remained continuously enrolled. Community college graduates of the Associate in Arts or Associate in Science degree programs who have earned 60 credit hours in approved transfer courses with a grade of “C” or better will receive at least 60 credit hours of academic credit upon admission to UNC Greensboro. A student who completes the Associate in Arts or Associate in Science degree prior to transfer to UNC Greensboro will have fulﬁlled the university’s lower-division general education requirements, but not intermediate-level general education requirements like the College of Arts and Sciences’ foreign language requirement. Also, due to degree requirements in some majors, additional lower-division courses at UNC Greensboro may be required beyond the general education courses and pre-major courses taken at the community college. Reverse Transfer Program This program awards an associate degree to students who previously attended a NC community college and earned at least 16 community college course credits. The student will earn their associate degree while completing courses for a baccalaureate degree at the four year institution. There is no cost to participate in the Reverse Transfer program. Students should contact their community college for fees related to printed diplomas and participating in graduation ceremonies. Students who transfer to a North Carolina university from one of the 58 North Carolina community colleges are given the opportunity to combine the credits earned at the university with credit already earned at the community college to determine if the associate degree requirements have been met. Students are responsible for opting in via UNCGenie, and the community college evaluates transcripts and awards associates degrees. The awarding of the associates degree will vary according to how many credits the student has earned. Please see the ofﬁcial Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) for eligibility and answers to all questions: http://www.northcarolina.edu/ reversetransfer (http://www.northcarolina.edu/reversetransfer/). Students who participate in North Carolina's Reverse Transfer Program and earn an Associate of Arts of Associate of Science will have fulﬁlled the university's lower-division general education requirements (Minerva's Academic Curriculum), but not intermediate-level general education requirements.  Due to degree requirements in some majors, additional lower-division courses at UNC Greensboro may be required beyond the general education courses and pre-major courses taken at the community college. 2Plus Programs The 2Plus program is for those North Carolina community college graduates who hold a speciﬁc Associate in Applied Science (A.A.S.) or Associate Degree in Nursing (A.D.N.) degree and desire to transfer into UNC Greensboro with advanced standing, pursuing a speciﬁc UNC Greensboro major. Articulation notices are sent to North Carolina community colleges listing the 2Plus admission requirements. Speciﬁc details of each notice may be obtained from the UNC Greensboro Ofﬁce of Undergraduate Admissions. 2Plus Articulation students are transfer students with several unique requirements and procedures. Details governing their enrollment are provided for in the articulation notices. The decision for admission is based on successful completion of the A.A.S./A.D.N. Degree and other speciﬁc factors outlined in the 2Plus articulation notice. Students admitted under the 2Plus agreement must notify the Ofﬁce of Undergraduate Admissions to change their major. A change in major may result in a change in the student’s transfer credit evaluation. No combination of 2Plus and community college transfer credit may exceed 64 credit hours. More details about 2Plus admission requirements are available at the 2Plus website: https://spartancentral.uncg.edu/registration-degree- planning/transfer-credit-information/2plus-equivalencies (https:// spartancentral.uncg.edu/registration-degree-planning/transfer-credit- information/2plus-equivalencies/).

Credit For Military Training And Prior Learning Assessment Military Course Credit Elective credit for military training may be awarded where UNC Greensboro has comparable courses and upon receipt of an ofﬁcial transcript from the Community College of the Air Force or a Joint Services Transcript. Transfer Students A transfer student is deﬁned as an undergraduate who has attended another postsecondary institution after graduating from high school. Requirements and Procedures It is required that applicants that have attended another college/ university (including 2-year, 4year, and/or junior colleges) submit an application for admission, all ofﬁcial transcripts for institutions of higher learning attended, and other needed documentation to the Ofﬁce of Undergraduate Admissions. To qualify for admission, applicants with at least 24 transferable hours must have a cumulative GPA of at least 2.0 on a 4.0 scale from all post- secondary coursework. For purposes of undergraduate admission, transfer applicants who have earned at least 24 transferable undergraduate credits from one or more regionally accredited, post-secondary institutions shall not be required to meet Minimum Admissions Requirements (MAR) and Minimum Course Requirements (MCR). 1. Transferable undergraduate credit counted as part of these 24 hours shall include: a. Credit earned at foreign institutions deemed to have the equivalence of regional accreditation; equivalence of regional accreditation generally refers to recognition by the foreign country’s Ministry of Education and/or recognition by a NACES- accredited organization offering credential evaluation services; and b. Credit awarded for prior learning as part of military service, with the military branch designated as the transfer institution c.  Undergraduate credits awarded for AP, IB, or other credit by exam shall not be included as part of these 24 hours. However, students are encouraged to submit ofﬁcial scores directly from the testing agency for credit evaluation. d. Applicants under the age of 21 with fewer than 24 hours of transferable undergraduate credit earned in a post-secondary institution will be evaluated based on ﬁrst-year (freshman) MAR and MCR. e. Transfer applicants who are 21 years of age or older and who have less than 24 transferable hours may be evaluated based on their post-secondary performance and/or high school performance. Transfer applicants who are 21 years of age or older, have a cumulative post-secondary GPA below a 2.0, are academically eligible to return to their prior institution, and have a 24-month break in their educational studies may be considered as non-traditional adult learners and may be admissible based upon an interview process and approval by the Director of Admissions. Comprehensive Articulation Agreement (CAA) Students who have completed an Associate Degree of Arts (AA) or Associate Degree of Science (AS) at a North Carolina community college with at least a 2.0 on a 4.0 scale will be admitted per State of NC’s Comprehensive Articulation Agreement (CAA).  Students who have met the CAA are considered to have met the general education requirements at UNC Greensboro. Students are still responsible for meeting any prerequisite course requirements required by academic major programs. UNC Greensboro will transfer no more than 64 credit hours (96 quarter- hours) earned at two-year institutions. Courses for which there is no equivalent course will transfer as elective credit. Veterans For purposes of undergraduate admission to UNC Greensboro, any individual having completed a minimum of three years of cumulative active duty service in the United States Armed Forces shall be exempt from minimum admissions requirements (MAR) and minimum course requirements (MCR), although they may be considered ﬁrst-time undergraduates (freshmen) for reporting and/or receipt of services. Applicants under the age of 21 shall be required to submit a high school transcript or GED, college transcript(s) (if applicable), and a relevant military transcript for evaluation. The branch of service reporting the source of transferred credit hours earned through military training will function as the applicant’s institution of transfer. If discharged from active duty, the veteran must have received an Administrative (non- punitive) Discharge. This policy shall not apply to veterans receiving a “Bad Conduct or Dishonorable Discharge.”  UNC Greensboro 2023-24 University Catalog 795 When enrolling at UNC Greensboro, the veteran should present a Certiﬁcate of Eligibility to the Military-Afﬁliated Services ofﬁce requesting that certiﬁcation of enrollment be sent to the VA. This Certiﬁcation of Enrollment is necessary before educational beneﬁts can be received. Certiﬁcation of Enrollment must be requested for each academic semester including summer sessions. Visiting Students Visiting Students A Visiting Student is deﬁned as a student currently attending a home institution other than UNC Greensboro but who seeks to take a course or courses at UNC Greensboro. • Applicants from other colleges or universities must obtain prior approval from their current institution to take courses at UNC Greensboro. • High school students must provide appropriate permission from the high school counselor and parent/guardian. The university assumes no responsibility for determining the student’s course selection when the credits are to be transferred elsewhere. Enrollment by permission from another institution does not obligate the university to continue the student’s enrollment at UNC Greensboro after the expiration of the permission period. Visiting students are limited to 21 cumulative credit hours. Non-Degree/Special Students Non-Degree or Special students are students who wish to take courses for the purpose of broadening their cultural interest or purely for their own ediﬁcation; students taking courses in preparation for application to a program but who are not seeking degree completion with UNC Greensboro; or graduates of four-year institutions seeking certiﬁcation. Interested individuals should: 1. Submit an application for admission with the non-refundable application fee. 2. Submit proof of high school graduation. In order to take a course that requires a prerequisite, appropriate transcripts showing successful completion of the prerequisite should be submitted to the Department of Admissions (unofﬁcial or ofﬁcial are both acceptable). Students admitted as non-degree seeking/special students are not eligible to receive any federal or university ﬁnancial aid. Visiting or non- degree students may apply for degree-seeking admission, submitting an application, fee, and all ofﬁcial transcripts. Courses taken at UNC Greensboro will be used in the admission review. Special students not seeking certiﬁcation may enroll in and accumulate no more than 21 credit hours. Credits earned while enrolled as a special student will not count toward graduation until all university admissions requirements have been met.  796 Graduate Admissions Graduate Admissions Graduate Admissions and Matriculation All degree, certiﬁcate, or non-degree-seeking students must submit a nonrefundable application fee to the University before the application is processed. Visit UNC Greensboro's Guide to Graduate Admissions (https://grs.uncg.edu/prospective/guide/) for any additional requirements. Note that some programs may specify additional material (e.g. portfolio, auditions, test scores). Overview Admission into a UNCG graduate degree or certiﬁcate program is a process shared by the Graduate School and the graduate program. To be considered for graduate admission, applicants must meet the requirements of the Graduate School and of the graduate program. Faculty in the graduate programs recommend students for admission to the Graduate School after they have assessed each prospective graduate student’s potential. Programs have signiﬁcant discretion in determining admission standards and class size based on factors such as availability of academic mentors, ﬁnancial support, laboratory space, and student distribution within interest areas. Neither an academic record exceeding minimum requirements, nor satisfactory scores on standardized tests, nor professional expertise alone will assure an applicant’s admission in this competitive environment. Rather, the overall record must indicate the strong likelihood that a prospective student will complete graduate study successfully. Each application to the Graduate School will result in one admission decision. Offers of admission are not ofﬁcial until approved by the Dean of the Graduate School. Ofﬁcial admission decisions are communicated to applicants by email from the Dean of the Graduate School. Prospective students can view the status of the admission application online at the application portal. Click “Manage Your Account” and then “View All Forms.” UNCG has staff who are charged with international recruitment. Additionally, UNCG uses independent contractors in the recruitment of international students. Agreements between Independent Recruiting Agencies and UNC Greensboro include a statement under the Contractor Responsibilities section that the Contractor shall “Recruit students with requisite academic qualiﬁcations who meet or exceed the university’s admission requirements.” UNCG provides those requirements in written materials, such as the UNCG Catalog, and in training sessions conducted by the International Programs Center. The Graduate School Ofﬁce of Admission has no direct contact with independent recruiting agencies. Students recruited by any means are shown no favoritism in the admissions process. This information is withheld from programs as they evaluate applicants. The only reason this information is collected is to analyze the efﬁcacy of recruitment efforts. Successful applicants are offered admission for a speciﬁc program in a speciﬁc term. Minimum Requirements for All Applicants • Applicants must submit a completed online application. • $65 nonrefundable application processing fee. • Applicants whose native language is not English must demonstrate English proﬁciency (See English Language Proﬁciency). • Per UNC Policy 700.5.1[R], the UNC system requires all applicants to answer questions regarding community standards/campus safety questions. Applicants may be required to submit to a criminal background check, based on their answers to the community standards/campus safety questions. • Completion of a bachelor’s degree and a graduate degree (if required by the program) from a U.S. college or university accredited by a regional accrediting association or completion of a bachelor's and a graduate degree (if required by the program) that is equivalent to a U.S. degree from an international college or university recognized and approved by the Ministry of Education or Commission responsible for higher education in the country where the degree is earned. If degree is in progress: • For U.S. degree, one transcript from all colleges and universities where a bachelor’s degree and a graduate degree (if required by the program) is in progress. • For international degree, a course-by-course evaluation from a National Association of Credential Evaluation Services (NACES®) service, showing proof of in progress status of U.S. equivalency of a bachelor's and a graduate degree (only if required by the program), credit hours, expected degree, and current GPA. Programs may substitute proof of earned U.S. equivalency graduate degree in lieu of U.S. equivalency bachelor's degree. If degree(s) have been awarded: • For U.S. degree(s), one transcript from all colleges and universities where a bachelor’s degree and a graduate degree (if required by the program) was earned • For international degree(s), a course-by-course evaluation from a National Association of Credential Evaluation Services (NACES®) service, showing proof of earned U.S. equivalency bachelor’s degree and a graduate degree (only if required by the program), credit hours, and GPA.

The ﬁnal ofﬁcial transcript showing the awarded international degree is still required. The Graduate School reserves the right to verify the accuracy and authenticity of the educational documents submitted. Disposition of Application Materials Credentials or supporting materials submitted for admission to the Graduate School become the property of the University and are not returned. No copies will be provided to third parties outside the University except when compelled by legal authority. Copies will, however, be provided to appropriate ofﬁces at the University in the interest of academic matters or ﬁnancial awards relative to the applicant. Applications and supporting documents are retained according to the retention policies of the state of North Carolina.

Transcripts Departments/programs may require additional transcripts. Pursuing Multiple Degree Programs Students are prohibited from pursuing multiple degree programs at the same time. Deferral of Admission Graduate admission to a degree or certiﬁcate program may be deferred for a maximum of one year from the initial term of admission. The student is responsible for contacting the department to determine if admission for subsequent terms is allowed. To request a deferral of admission, admitted students must submit a completed Deferral of Admission Form, found within the online application, to the admitting department’s Graduate Program Director  798 Graduate Admissions no later than the ﬁrst day of classes of the term of initial admission. The deferral request must be for a speciﬁc entry term. The entry term must also be for a term the program has listed as an offered admit term. After considering the request, the department will forward the form to the Graduate School, who will notify the student of the decision. Merit- based ﬁnancial aid, i.e. teaching/research assistantships, scholarships, and fellowships will not be deferred; the student must compete again for the awards. Students who have not enrolled and have not requested a deferral of admission will be required to reapply. Military-afﬁliated students should contact the Graduate School for individual assistance with extended deferrals. Non-credential-seeking (Visiting) Students Non-degree students who wish to take graduate-level courses (courses numbered 500 – 749*) must have earned a baccalaureate degree from an accredited college or university and must apply through the Graduate School. The Graduate School does not admit an individual as a non- degree student (as if they were in a program). Instead, approved non- degree students will receive notice from the Graduate School that they may register for classes. Visiting students are restricted from registering for any course that is not on a program’s list of approved courses. Non-degree students who wish to take undergraduate-level courses (courses numbered 100-499) must apply through undergraduate admissions, even if they have previously earned an undergraduate degree Non-degree seeking students must submit a new application for each semester in which they wish to enroll. A non-refundable fee is charged each time a non-degree seeking application is submitted. An undergraduate transcript(s) from the degree-granting institution is required with the initial application. The transcript is kept on ﬁle for any subsequent applications and will only need to be submitted once. Non-degree students who are permitted to enroll for graduate courses may take courses numbered 500 –749 that have not been restricted by the departments (see Non-degree Seeking Applicants (https:// grs.uncg.edu/prospective/visitingapplicants/).) With the instructor’s approval, non-degree seeking students may submit a written petition to the Graduate Program Director or the Department Head to enroll in a restricted course; however, independent study is reserved for only degree seeking students. To pursue a degree at any time, a non-degree student must formally apply for admission to the Graduate School. If the student meets all Graduate School and program standards and is granted admission, a maximum of nine (9) credits earned while in non-degree status may be applied to an academic degree program; three (3) credits may be applied towards a certiﬁcate program. Credit earned must fall within the timeline for completing the degree or certiﬁcate. Non-degree seeking students are not eligible for ﬁnancial aid. * Visiting students are not permitted to enroll in courses numbered 750 or higher. Public School Personnel Public school teachers and administrators who wish to take courses solely for licensure renewal credit may do so as non-degree seeking students. Students who meet all requirements for admission as a graduate degree student will also receive the licensure renewal credit. If credit is to be applied to a graduate degree, the student must submit an application to the Graduate School before the completion of the course. Readmission and Catalog Policy The University Catalog is the publication that documents all academic policies, regulations, and program requirements for a given academic year for all students and programs. A student's catalog year identiﬁes the set of curriculum requirements and regulations for program completion. The catalog year is established for the individual student upon declaration or change of the program. A student may change a catalog year without a change of program or minor only to a more recent catalog. The student may request this change formally through their department. Any student who has been inactivated must reapply for admission to the University. If admitted, the student will be assigned to the catalog requirements for the program in effect for the re-admit term. Readmission after Academic Dismissal A student who is dismissed for academic reasons will be eligible to submit a new application after two semesters or the equivalent and may be admitted only upon the recommendation of the major department head or Graduate Program Director and with the approval of the Dean of the Graduate School. While on academic dismissal, students are not eligible to take courses as a non-degree seeking student. Accelerated Master’s Programs An Accelerated Master’s Program (AMP) allows a student to begin accumulating credits towards completion of a UNCG master's degree while still enrolled as an undergraduate. Successful undergraduate applicants are given an early decision on their graduate application pending successful completion of the baccalaureate degree. These graduate-level courses will count towards both the baccalaureate degree and the graduate degree; the grades will be recorded on both transcripts. Undergraduate students may apply for admission to the AMP after the completion of 60 credit hours with at least 30 of these credits at UNCG. Minimal criteria for admission to any AMP will include a UNCG cumulative undergraduate GPA of at least 3.5. The student must apply for admission to the AMP through the Graduate School. To ensure a timely decision and access to course enrollment, students must apply for admission to an Accelerated Master’s Program by July 1 for Fall AMP course enrollment, November 15 for Spring enrollment, and April 1 for Summer enrollment. International students who are admitted into an Accelerated Master’s Program should work with the Graduate School and the International Programs Center to apply for a visa extension. A student enrolled in an AMP program is prohibited from Dual Bachelor’s- Master’s Registration. All AMP students are considered to be undergraduate students until the conferral of the baccalaureate degree, which requires an application to graduate from the baccalaureate program. No more than 12 graduate- level credit hours taken as an undergraduate may be applied toward both the undergraduate degree and the graduate degree. To be able to apply  UNC Greensboro 2023-24 University Catalog 799 these credits towards the graduate degree, students must achieve grades of B or higher in the AMP courses. Dual Bachelor's-Master's Registration Students who do not wish to enroll in a UNCG graduate program may register for graduate-level courses if they have no more than twelve (12) credit hours remaining to fulﬁll the requirements of their bachelor’s degree program. Students must apply for admission to a graduate program before requests for dual registration can be approved, but they do not have to be formally admitted until the end of the semester in which credit is earned. For dual registration status, the approvals of the Graduate School, the University Registrar’s Ofﬁce, the Graduate Program Director in the appropriate graduate program(s), and the student’s undergraduate major adviser are required. Total graduate credit obtained in this dual status may not exceed 12 credits. Graduate courses are not applied to the undergraduate degree. A student enrolled in Dual Bachelor’s Master’s Registration may not be concurrently enrolled in and AMP program.

Course Preﬁxes See the topic Course Preﬁxes (p. 802) in this Academic Program Terminology section. Course Numbers and Levels Course level numbers are structured as listed below. Course Level Number Description 100-199 intended primarily for freshmen 200-299 intended primarily for sophomores 300-399 intended primarily for juniors 400-499 intended primarily for seniors 500-599 for all graduate students 600-749 for all graduate students, including doctoral 750-799 doctoral level only Undergraduates are reminded that a minimum of 36 credit hours must be completed at the 300 level or above to meet graduation requirements. Course Credit Hours Credits for all courses are reported in credit hours. A credit hour credit equals one 50-minute class period per week or its equivalent throughout one semester. The number of credits given for each course is listed as part of the course description immediately following the course title. Course Type Abbreviations with Instructional Delivery Method See the topic Course Type Abbreviations with Instructional Delivery Method (p. 803) in this Academic Program Terminology section. Course Description The description of a course is necessarily brief and is intended to give students a concise overview of course content. A course syllabus, which contains complete details about a course’s content and requirements, may be obtained from the department or instructor. A prerequisite is a course that must be completed before another course may be taken. A corequisite is a course that must be taken concurrently must be met before that course may be taken. A student may not enroll in a course without having completed the proper prerequisites unless these prerequisites have been waived by the head of the department in which the course is offered. Cross-Listed Courses Each semester a number of courses are cross-listed with courses taught in a different department. These courses meet in the same room at the same time but have different course preﬁxes and may have different numbers. Cross-listed courses are listed under the Cross Listed Courses heading (“Same as . . .”). Students should be aware of cross-listings before registering in order to avoid taking a course for which they will not receive additional credit. Frequency of Course Offering Many courses indicate the semester(s) in which they are usually offered. This information is listed under the Offered heading: • Fall and Spring—course usually offered both fall and spring semesters. • Fall and Spring and Summer—course usually offered fall and spring semesters and summer session. • (Fall or Spring)—course usually offered either fall or spring semesters. • (Fall or Spring or Summer)—course may be offered fall semester, or spring semester, or summer session. • (Fall or Spring or Winter)—course may be offered fall semester, or spring semester, or winter session. • (Fall)—course usually offered fall only. • (Spring)—course usually offered spring only. • (Summer)—course usually offered summer only. • (Alt)—course usually offered only in alternate semesters or years. • (Even, Odd)—course usually offered in even or odd semesters or years. • (Occ)—course offered occasionally. Students should also be aware that regularly scheduled undergraduate classes for which fewer than ten students enroll (or graduate classes for which fewer than ﬁve students enroll) will be offered only with special approval of the Provost. If enrollment does not justify continuation of a class, the class may not be offered that semester. General Education Requirement Abbreviations See the General Education Program topic in the University Requirements section. Other Course Restrictions Some courses carry additional restrictions (Freshmen only; Majors only; etc.). Such restrictions are also listed in the prerequisite notation. Repeat-for-Credit Notation Some courses may be repeated for credit under special circumstances. Such information is listed in the Notes. Grading Method Courses are graded by letter grade (A–F) unless otherwise noted in the course description. If a course is graded other than by letter grade, this information is stated after the prerequisite listing. Also see the topic on Grading in the Academic Regulations and Policies Section. Pass/Not Pass Courses Undergraduate/advanced undergraduate courses that are graded P/NP (Pass/Not Pass) or S/U (Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory) and are so noted in their descriptions. Equivalent Course Credit A number of undergraduate courses have course content that is considered equivalent to other similar courses. The course entry in this bulletin will contain a notation under the Notes heading—such as “Students may not earn credit for both . . .” Students should be aware of  UNC Greensboro 2023-24 University Catalog 805 such equivalencies before registering in order to avoid taking a course for which they will not receive additional credit. Major Description and Program Requirements and Courses Explanation Undergraduate Areas of Study Undergraduate areas of study include all majors, concentrations, teacher licensure programs, minors, and second majors that are available to UNC Greensboro students. Students seeking a baccalaureate degree must select a primary major, and may, after consultation with an advisor, also select a minor or a second major. Major A major is a formalized curricular program leading to a degree. A concentration is a formalized curricular sequence established to achieve a speciﬁc goal within a major. Each academic unit or department establishes the course requirements for each major program, concentrations within a major, and related area requirements. All program requirements follow the general structure described below. Major Description The following information is always included at the beginning of the major listing: 1. Name of major 2. Degree awarded 3. Total credit hours required for the degree 4. Concentrations available (if more than one area of study is available) Program Admission Requirements Special program admission and/or continuation requirements, if any, are listed immediately following the description of the major and degree. A number of programs have requirements that must be met before the student can be formally admitted to the major and permitted to take upper-level courses. Such requirements usually involve completion of foundation courses, achievement of a certain GPA, and completion of a speciﬁed number of credit hours. Certain programs require portfolio review or audition for admission. Program Course Requirements General Education Requirements All students completing undergraduate degrees at UNC Greensboro are required to complete General Education Requirements. All undergraduate programs follow General Education requirements. Most programs in the College of Arts and Sciences have College Additional Requirements (CIC) in addition to the General Education requirements. General Education requirements, including speciﬁc courses speciﬁed by the program, are listed prior to the major requirements. Major Requirements Major requirements include all courses that must be taken within the major department for completion of the degree. All undergraduate majors require a minimum of 27 credits in the major program of study. Majors that provide students with more than one concentration or area of study within the major will usually separate the Major Requirements into Core Requirements and Additional Concentration Requirements. Core courses are those courses required of all students in the major, regardless of concentration. Concentration requirements are additional courses required only for a speciﬁc concentration. A program of study taken by a student as a second major, in addition to the student’s primary major, must meet all requirements as stated for that major. For example, a student pursuing English as the primary major who wishes to obtain a second major in French, must meet all the requirements for the English major as well as those for the French major. Related Area Requirements A number of majors require courses from other departments or programs for completion of the degree. Such courses are listed as “Related Area” requirements following the major requirements. Teacher Licensure Requirements Programs that lead to teacher licensure also list teacher licensure requirements. Second Academic Concentration Requirements for Teacher Licensure Programs Several teacher licensure programs require students to complete a second academic concentration in addition to the primary major program. Students in teacher education programs should check with their advisors or with the School of Education Licensure Programs for available second academic concentrations. Electives Most programs do not specify which electives a student must take although some may make suggestions. Electives are those courses taken to complete the credits required for the degree after fulﬁlling General Education requirements and major, related and/or other program requirements. Minors A minor is a formalized curricular sequence taken by a student outside his or her major area of study. Programs that can be taken as minors are described following descriptions of the major and second major. A minimum of 15 credit hours in a department is required to complete an area of study as a minor. Several areas of study can be taken only as minors. See individual programs for details. Special Curriculum Option (Plan II) For students whose intellectual interests and professional goals span more than one Academic Department, a special curriculum option—called Plan II—allows students to design an individualized interdisciplinary course of study drawing on existing faculty expertise and interest. Plan II programs should reflect the same kind of rigorous intellectual investigation found in UNC Greensboro’s established department based majors. Rigorous intellectual investigation varies by discipline, but typically involves a scaffolded set of courses that build upon each other; some degree of formal theoretical analysis is often, if not universally, desirable. Developing an individualized program is a time consuming process, often taking one year from initial intent to ﬁnal approval. Students must ﬁle a statement of intent to pursue Plan II with the University Curriculum Committee prior to completing their ﬁrst 45 institutional credit hours, and submit the full plan for review prior to completing their ﬁrst 60 institutional credit hours. Students desiring to pursue Plan II should be  806 Major Description and Program Requirements and Courses Explanation advised that there is no guarantee that their proposed program will lead to graduation until it has been fully approved. Required steps have been adopted by the Undergraduate Curriculum Committee for approving Plan II programs. The following is an abbreviated description of the procedures that must be followed: 1. Consult with the Student’s First Ofﬁce regarding established UNC Greensboro majors &/or minors to determine if a program that supports the student’s interdisciplinary goals already exists (Plan II programs that replicate existing programs with minor variations will not be approved). 2. Select a faculty advisor with academic expertise in the primary component of the interdisciplinary major. 3. With the help of the faculty advisor, Select another faculty member with expertise in a different component of the interdisciplinary major, as well as a representative of the Unit Advising representative to serve on an advisory committee. 4. Develop a formal proposal with the advisory committee. 5. Proposal must be reviewed by the lead faculty advisor’s academic unit’s curriculum committee. 6. Proposals are then reviewed by the Undergraduate Curriculum Committee Minor modiﬁcations to an approved Plan II program may be made if approved by both the faculty advisor and the University Registrar’s Ofﬁce. Other modiﬁcations require the full process outlined.  UNC Greensboro 2023-24 University Catalog 807 Graduate Policies Preface The UNCG Graduate School Handbook contains the policies, procedures, regulations, and deadlines, as created and revised by the Graduate School’s Policy Committee.* Revisions are ﬁnalized by the Graduate Council, after a one-month comment period open to Graduate Faculty. It is the student’s responsibility to know and to follow all policies, procedures, regulations, and deadlines. Each graduate program maintains a handbook that describes admission expectations speciﬁc to that program and may have additional regulations. SECTION I: Covers general academic requirements and regulations. SECTION II: Covers ﬁnancial information, assistantships, fellowships, and credentialing process for graduate teaching associates. SECTION III: Provides a summary of Graduate School regulations for all certiﬁcates and degrees. Ofﬁcial University Communication: According to UNCG University policy, e-mail is the ofﬁcial method of communication. All ofﬁcial communications will be transmitted through UNCG University e-mail to students’ ofﬁcial UNCG email addresses at the “uncg.edu” domain. Students are responsible for monitoring this e-mail account at all times while enrolled at UNCG. Failure to monitor this account may result in missing important announcements and deadlines and will not serve as a basis for an appeal or modiﬁcation of deadlines. For answers to questions about Graduate School policies, contact the Ofﬁce of the Dean of the Graduate School at 336-334-3287 or e-mail the Dean’s administrative assistant. * Last Updated: April 24, 2020. Section I: Academic Requirements and Regulations Graduate Admissions and Enrollment All degree, certiﬁcate, or non-degree-seeking students must submit a nonrefundable application fee to the University before the application is processed. Visit UNC Greensboro's Guide to Graduate Admissions (https://grs.uncg.edu/prospective/guide/) for any additional requirements. Note that some programs may specify additional material (e.g. portfolio, auditions, test scores). Overview Admission into a UNCG graduate degree or certiﬁcate program is a process shared by the Graduate School and the graduate program. To be considered for graduate admission, applicants must meet the requirements of the Graduate School and of the graduate program. Faculty in the graduate programs recommend students for admission to the Graduate School after they have assessed each prospective graduate student’s potential. Programs have signiﬁcant discretion in determining admission standards and class size based on factors such as availability of academic mentors, ﬁnancial support, laboratory space, and student distribution within interest areas. Neither an academic record exceeding minimum requirements, nor satisfactory scores on standardized tests, nor professional expertise alone will assure an applicant’s admission in this competitive environment. Rather, the overall record must indicate the strong likelihood that a prospective student will complete graduate study successfully. Each application to the Graduate School will result in one admission decision. Offers of admission are not ofﬁcial until approved by the Dean of the Graduate School. Ofﬁcial admission decisions are communicated to applicants by email from the Dean of the Graduate School. Prospective students can view the status of the admission application online at the application portal. Click “Manage Your Account” and then “View All Forms.” UNCG has staff who are charged with international recruitment. Additionally, UNCG uses independent contractors in the recruitment of international students. Agreements between Independent Recruiting Agencies and UNC Greensboro include a statement under the Contractor Responsibilities section that the Contractor shall “Recruit students with requisite academic qualiﬁcations who meet or exceed the university’s admission requirements.” UNCG provides those requirements in written materials, such as the UNCG Catalog, and in training sessions conducted by the International Programs Center. The Graduate School Ofﬁce of Admission has no direct contact with independent recruiting agencies. Students recruited by any means are shown no favoritism in the admissions process. This information is withheld from programs as they evaluate applicants. The only reason this information is collected is to analyze the efﬁcacy of recruitment efforts. Successful applicants are offered admission for a speciﬁc program in a speciﬁc term. Minimum Requirements for All Applicants • Applicants must submit a completed online application. • $65 nonrefundable application processing fee. • Applicants whose native language is not English must demonstrate English proﬁciency (See English Language Proﬁciency). • Per UNC Policy 700.5.1[R], the UNC system requires all applicants to answer questions regarding community standards/campus safety questions.

The ﬁnal ofﬁcial transcript showing the awarded international degree is still required. The Graduate School reserves the right to verify the accuracy and authenticity of the educational documents submitted. Disposition of Application Materials Credentials or supporting materials submitted for admission to the Graduate School become the property of the University and are not returned. No copies will be provided to third parties outside the University except when compelled by legal authority. Copies will, however, be provided to appropriate ofﬁces at the University in the interest of academic matters or ﬁnancial awards relative to the applicant. Applications and supporting documents are retained according to the retention policies of the state of North Carolina.

Visiting students are restricted from registering for any course that is not on a program’s list of approved courses. Non-degree students who wish to take undergraduate-level courses (courses numbered 100-499) must apply through undergraduate admissions, even if they have previously earned an undergraduate degree Non-degree seeking students must submit a new application for each semester in which they wish to enroll. A non-refundable fee is charged each time a non-degree seeking application is submitted. An undergraduate transcript(s) from the degree-granting institution is required with the initial application. The transcript is kept on ﬁle for any subsequent applications and will only need to be submitted once. Non-degree students who are permitted to enroll for graduate courses may take courses numbered 500 –749 that have not been restricted by the departments (see Non-degree Seeking Applicants (https:// grs.uncg.edu/prospective/visitingapplicants/).) With the instructor’s approval, non-degree seeking students may submit a written petition to the Graduate Program Director or the Department Head to enroll in a restricted course; however, independent study is reserved for only degree seeking students. To pursue a degree at any time, a non-degree student must formally apply for admission to the Graduate School. If the student meets all Graduate School and program standards and is granted admission, a maximum of nine (9) credits earned while in non-degree status may be applied to an academic degree program; three (3) credits may be applied towards a certiﬁcate program. Credit earned must fall within the timeline for completing the degree or certiﬁcate. Non-degree seeking students are not eligible for ﬁnancial aid. * Visiting students are not permitted to enroll in courses numbered 750 or higher. Public School Personnel Public school teachers and administrators who wish to take courses solely for licensure renewal credit may do so as non-degree seeking students. Students who meet all requirements for admission as a graduate degree student will also receive the licensure renewal credit. If credit is to be applied to a graduate degree, the student must submit an application to the Graduate School before the completion of the course. Readmission and Catalog Policy The University Catalog is the publication that documents all academic policies, regulations, and program requirements for a given academic year for all students and programs. A student's catalog year identiﬁes the set of curriculum requirements and regulations for program completion. The catalog year is established for the individual student upon declaration or change of the program. A student may change a catalog year without a change of program or minor only to a more recent catalog. The student may request this change formally through their department. Any student who has been inactivated must reapply for admission to the University. If admitted, the student will be assigned to the catalog requirements for the program in effect for the re-admit term.  810 Graduate Policies Readmission after Academic Dismissal A student who is dismissed for academic reasons will be eligible to submit a new application after two semesters or the equivalent and may be admitted only upon the recommendation of the major department head or Graduate Program Director and with the approval of the Dean of the Graduate School. While on academic dismissal, students are not eligible to take courses as a non-degree seeking student. Accelerated Master’s Programs An Accelerated Master’s Program (AMP) allows a student to begin accumulating credits towards completion of a UNCG master's degree while still enrolled as an undergraduate. Successful undergraduate applicants are given an early decision on their graduate application pending successful completion of the baccalaureate degree. These graduate-level courses will count towards both the baccalaureate degree and the graduate degree; the grades will be recorded on both transcripts. Undergraduate students may apply for admission to the AMP after the completion of 60 credit hours with at least 30 of these credits at UNCG. Minimal criteria for admission to any AMP will include a UNCG cumulative undergraduate GPA of at least 3.5. The student must apply for admission to the AMP through the Graduate School. To ensure a timely decision and access to course enrollment, students must apply for admission to an Accelerated Master’s Program by July 1 for Fall AMP course enrollment, November 15 for Spring enrollment, and April 1 for Summer enrollment. International students who are admitted into an Accelerated Master’s Program should work with the Graduate School and the International Programs Center to apply for a visa extension. A student enrolled in an AMP program is prohibited from Dual Bachelor’s- Master’s Registration. All AMP students are considered to be undergraduate students until the conferral of the baccalaureate degree, which requires an application to graduate from the baccalaureate program. No more than 12 graduate- level credit hours taken as an undergraduate may be applied toward both the undergraduate degree and the graduate degree. To be able to apply these credits towards the graduate degree, students must achieve grades of B or higher in the AMP courses. Dual Bachelor's-Master's Registration Students who do not wish to enroll in a UNCG graduate program may register for graduate-level courses if they have no more than twelve (12) credit hours remaining to fulﬁll the requirements of their bachelor’s degree program. Students must apply for admission to a graduate program before requests for dual registration can be approved, but they do not have to be formally admitted until the end of the semester in which credit is earned. For dual registration status, the approvals of the Graduate School, the University Registrar’s Ofﬁce, the Graduate Program Director in the appropriate graduate program(s), and the student’s undergraduate major adviser are required. Total graduate credit obtained in this dual status may not exceed 12 credits. Graduate courses are not applied to the undergraduate degree. A student enrolled in Dual Bachelor’s Master’s Registration may not be concurrently enrolled in and AMP program. Faculty as Students Faculty at UNCG may not pursue a graduate degree or certiﬁcate in their home department or degree-offering unit. For exceptions, the unit dean may petition the Dean of the Graduate School. Eligibility to Remain in Graduate School The Graduate School may dismiss a student for academic reasons, violation of the academic integrity policy, and/or student conduct violations as described in each program’s graduate handbook. Academic Good Standing Students enter Graduate School with no academic standing and are expected to earn at least a GPA of 3.0 in their ﬁrst semester to be placed in Academic Good Standing. Continuing students must maintain a cumulative GPA of at least 3.0 in all graduate course work at UNCG to remain in Academic Good Standing. Academic Probation Any student whose cumulative GPA for all graduate courses falls below 3.0 will be placed on Academic Probation, effective for the next term during which the student is enrolled. Probationary status will be removed and the student returned to Academic Good Standing if (1) the student’s GPA for each term during which the student is on probation is 3.0 or better, and (2) the student’s cumulative GPA for all graduate courses is at least 3.0 at the end of the semester in which the student completes nine (9) semester hours after being placed on Probation. If Probationary status is not removed upon the completion of 9 semester hours after being placed on Probation, or if the student achieves a term GPA below 3.0 while on Academic Probation, the student will be dismissed from the program and will be ineligible to continue in the Graduate School. Students on probation are ineligible for assistantships or fellowships. If the Graduate School determines that it is not possible to return to Academic Good standing within the allotted credit hours for graduation, that student will not be placed on Academic Probation. Instead, that student will be immediately dismissed from the Graduate School. Students who meet the criteria to be placed on Academic Probation more than once in the same program will not be placed on Academic Probation; instead, they will be immediately dismissed from the Graduate School. While on Academic Dismissal, students are not eligible to take graduate- level courses as a non-degree seeking student. Should a student complete or withdraw from one academic program and begin study in another academic program, all grades remain part of the student’s academic record and contribute to the student’s cumulative graduate GPA. Students may refer to Graduate Grading for a more detailed description of grading policies. Graduate Exams Graduate students who fail any written or oral milestone exam must petition their advisory committee for permission to take it again. The Graduate School will dismiss any graduate student who fails two attempts for a milestone exam. Satisfactory Progress Toward Degree All graduate students are required to demonstrate satisfactory progress towards degree completion. Department Handbooks shall document the procedure to annually assess students’ progress to degree completion. The Graduate Program Director (GPD) must notify the Graduate School  UNC Greensboro 2023-24 University Catalog 811 of any student determined not to be making satisfactory academic progress; that student shall be placed on Academic Probation.  A student who subsequently fails to make satisfactory progress towards the degree and be removed from probation shall be dismissed from the Graduate School. Satisfactory Academic Professionalism Satisfactory performance in the Graduate School also involves maintaining the professional standards and academic progress expected in a discipline or program. Failure to maintain the standards or progress set out in a student’s departmental or program handbook may result in dismissal from the program. Satisfactory Academic Progress for Financial Aid Federal and state governments require each educational institution to deﬁne standards of progress for students seeking ﬁnancial aid. All students who wish to qualify for ﬁnancial aid while attending UNCG must meet the following standards: • Minimum grade point average • Minimum semester credit hour completion rate • Cumulative completion rate—attempted vs. earned hours • Completion of a degree within a maximum number of credit hours To view the complete SAP (Satisfactory Academic Progress) Policy click here (https://ﬁa.uncg.edu/forms/2018-19/1819SAPpolicy.pdf) to view the document. Student Rights, Responsibilities, and Registration Rights Students are entitled to privacy, expression, nondiscrimination, non- harassment, and the opportunity to appeal, petition, or contest university actions pursuant to the procedures referenced below. Responsibilities The student is responsible for: • observing all university and Graduate School policies, regulations, procedures and academic requirements, including speciﬁc requirements of the program; and • maintaining a high standard of academic integrity. Academic Integrity Policy Academic integrity is founded upon and encompasses the following ﬁve values: honesty, trust, fairness, respect, and responsibility. First responsibility for academic integrity lies with individual students and faculty members of the UNC Greensboro community. A violation of academic integrity is an act harmful to all other students, faculty, and the entire community. Speciﬁc information on the Academic Integrity Policy and obligations of faculty and students may be found here (https:// osrr.uncg.edu/academic-integrity/). Appeals for Academic Decisions Qualiﬁed faculty members are expected to exercise objective judgment in making academic decisions. Under certain circumstances speciﬁed below, students may appeal these decisions. Students must submit appeals in writing and include all documented evidence. Students will receive written determinations regarding their appeals. Students may appeal to the Graduate School under at least one of the following circumstances: • The academic decision was applied in a manner inconsistent with University policy. • The academic decision was arrived at arbitrarily or the policy was unequally applied. • There was a flaw in the student’s right of due process. The procedure speciﬁed below is to be used to resolve grievances against decisions or actions that were made by employees or agents of UNCG that would adversely affect the student's progress toward a graduate degree. Graduate Student Grievance Procedures Graduate students may use this procedure to ﬁle a grievance against an adverse decision made by a University faculty member or program director (“academic ofﬁcer(s)”) that violates University policy or applicable laws. What May Be Grieved 1. Decisions made by academic ofﬁcers that: a. Adversely affect the graduate student; and, b. Involve a misapplication or misinterpretation of University policies, regulations, rules, or a violation of state or federal law. 2. Graduate Student Final Course Grades What Is Not Covered By This Procedure Student disciplinary matters and allegations of discrimination or harassment are not covered by this procedure. Please see the Discriminatory Conduct Poli (https://policy.uncg.edu/ university_policies/discriminatory-conduct/)cy (https:// policy.uncg.edu/university_policies/discriminatory-conduct/) and the Student Code of Conduct (https://osrr.uncg.edu/wp- content/uploads/2021/08/Student-Code-of-Conduct-8-13-21-1.pdf) for more information. Other grievances may be handled using Student Grievance and Appeals Policies and Procedures (https://sa.uncg.edu/division-of-student-affairs/students/ academic-resources/student-grievance-and-appeals-policies-and- procedures/). Adverse Decisions Informal Grievance Procedure Before submitting a formal grievance, the graduate student shall ﬁrst attempt to informally resolve the issue with the academic ofﬁcer responsible for the action or decision being grieved. The student shall discuss the problem in a meeting with the academic ofﬁcer within 15 business days after receiving notice of the adverse action. If informal resolution is unsatisfactory, the student may proceed by ﬁling a written formal grievance with their Graduate Program Director (“GPD”). Formal Grievance Procedure 1. The graduate student must submit a written appeal (email allowed) addressed to their GPD within thirty (30) business days following the informal discussion. The Graduate Program Director or the Unit Dean may extend the time limit for good cause shown if the grievant makes a request for extension of time within the thirty (30) day period. If the grievance is against  812 Graduate Policies the GPD, then the student should submit the formal grievance to their Academic Unit Dean (“Unit Dean”). Filing occurs when the written grievance is submitted to the GPD or the Unit Dean. 2. This communication must clearly set forth, in reasonable detail: 1) what decision is being challenged, 2) which academic ofﬁcer made the decision, 3) how the policy, regulation, rule, or law was misapplied or misinterpreted, and 4) the remedy sought. The graduate student may attach additional documentation or evidence if necessary. 3. The GPD or Unit Dean shall review the submission, consult with the academic ofﬁcer involved, and provide a written decision by email to the graduate student within 30 business days after the ﬁling date. An additional extension may be granted for good cause shown, and the need for an extension and the anticipated decision date will be communicated to the graduate student by email. 4. If the student is not satisﬁed with the outcome at this level, the student may submit a written notice of appeal (email allowed) to the Dean of the Graduate School within ﬁfteen (15) business days of receiving the written decision. Graduate School Appeals The Dean of the Graduate School will convene the Graduate Appeals Committee after receiving timely written notice of appeal. The Appeals Committee is comprised of members of the Graduate Council who are assigned to this standing committee. The Appeals Committee must review all written documentation in the case, and it must provide the graduate student grievant with an opportunity to appear in person to present testimony and evidence. The student appearing before the Appeals Committee may bring one support person who is not allowed to address the committee. The Unit Dean or their designee shall be invited to the hearing to observe but will not participate. Appeal Committee Procedure 1. The Appeals Committee Chair may provide a brief overview of the appeal at the beginning of the hearing. This statement shall be limited to an objective summary of the issues present in the appeal. 2. The student will state their case. There will be no interruptions, but committee members may ask clarifying questions by asking permission from the Appeals Committee Chair. 3. The academic ofﬁcer whose decision is being appealed will state their case.  There will be no interruptions, but Committee members may ask clarifying questions by asking permission from the Appeals Committee Chair. 4. Committee members may also ask questions of any other involved parties present. 5. The Student will to respond and ask questions of the academic ofﬁcer and other involved parties who previously provided information 6. The Appeals Committee will have the opportunity to ask ﬁnal questions of both the student and the academic ofﬁcer. 7. The members of the Appeals Committee will deliberate in private. 8. The Appeals Committee Chair will send a written report within ﬁfteen (15) business days to the Unit Dean or designee and the Dean of the Graduate School. This report must describe the facts of the appeal as determined by the Appeals Committee after hearing the evidence and the Committee’s recommendation for the action to be taken. 9. The Unit Dean or designee and the Dean of the Graduate School shall jointly review the report and consult with the Provost. Then, the Dean of the Graduate School will make the ﬁnal University decision and provide copies of this decision in writing to all involved parties within 20 business days of receiving the Appeals Committee report. This decision is ﬁnal. Grade Grievances Applicable Circumstances 1. Graduate students may appeal a ﬁnal course grade within 30 business days of the posting date, if: a. The grade assignment is detrimental to the student; and, b. One of the following is true: i. The grade was calculated in a matter inconsistent with University policy, the syllabus, or changes to the syllabus; or, ii. There was an arithmetic or clerical error; or, iii. The instructor failed to assign or remove an Incomplete (“I”), or to initiate a grade change as agreed upon with the student; or, iv. A No Report (“NR”) grade caused a student to be placed on probation or dismissed from the graduate school. 2. This grievance procedure does not apply to test grades, partial grades, or grade changes resulting from Academic Integrity violations that are administered by the Ofﬁce of Student Rights and Responsibilities. Grade Grievance Procedure 1. If an attempt to obtain an informal resolution is unsatisfactory, then the student may submit a written complaint or email to the instructor who assigned the grade, with a copy to the department head for review. 2. If the instructor is no longer employed at UNCG, the department head assumes the role of the instructor. 3. The written complaint must identify the basis of the grade appeal and must state in detail the applicable criteria for the appeal and why the student believes that the grade should be changed. 4. If the request is approved by the instructor and endorsed by the department head, then the instructor will change the ﬁnal course grade. 5. If the appeal is not endorsed by the instructor and department head, then the student may forward the written complaint to the Unit dean for further review, within ﬁfteen (15) business days. 6. The Unit Dean reviews the written complaint and informs the instructor of the student’s appeal. The instructor may ﬁle a written response within ten (10) business days of receiving notice from the Unit Dean. Within a reasonable time, normally no longer than ﬁfteen (15) business days, the Unit Dean sends a written response to the student, with a copy to the department head and instructor. The Unit Dean’s response shall include a recommendation of whether or not the instructor should re- evaluate the student’s work in the course(s). 7. The instructor determines if a grade change is warranted, and if so, will submit a grade change.  UNC Greensboro 2023-24 University Catalog 813 8. If this outcome is not satisfactory to the student, then the student may ﬁle an appeal with the Graduate School by submitting the same written complaint to the Dean of the Graduate School within 15 business days of receiving notice of the unsatisfactory outcome. No additional documents may be submitted. 9. This appeal is governed by the steps listed in Section above for Graduate School Appeals. Student/Advisor Responsibilities and Plan of Study The student is responsible for continuing in satisfactory academic standing and for meeting all degree requirements and deadlines for graduation or licensure. In addition to graduate student policies detailed in the Catalog, graduate students are expected to comply with the general regulations of the University as set forth in the UNCG Policies for Students available online here (https://sa.uncg.edu/handbook/policies/). Academic Advisory Committee The academic program’s Graduate Program Director (GPD) or its Department Head assigns each graduate student an initial academic advisor(s). This initial advisor (documented in Banner) could be the GPD or any other member of the Graduate Faculty. If the Department appoints Academic Advisory Committees, the appointment form must be submitted no later than the close of the registration window for the second semester of study, before the completion of eighteen (18) hours. Plan of Study The student is expected to develop an initial Plan of Study (POS) in consultation with the assigned advisor(s). This POS is a guiding document that interprets curriculum requirements and arranges an orderly sequence of activities for the student’s progress toward the anticipated degree. It is evaluated and approved by the Graduate Program Director and then ﬁled with the Graduate School. This must be accomplished no later than the close of the registration window for the second semester of study, prior to the completion of eighteen (18) hours for doctoral and MFA students and before completion of 50% of course work for master’s students. Upon formation of the Thesis or Dissertation committee, the chair of that committee becomes the student’s advisor, documented in Banner. Students are advised to consult with their advisors frequently and to request changes to the POS as needed. Each time a POS is changed, the new POS must be ﬁled with the Graduate School. Course Credit Transfer Credit (Graduate) In some instances, work done in other institutions may be counted toward the degree. Hours only, not grades, may be transferred from other institutions. Please see the Summary of Master’s Requirements and the Summary of Doctoral Requirements in Section III for transfer credit information speciﬁc to the type of graduate program. If transfer credit is to be considered, the following stipulations must be present: • All credit offered in transfer must have been taken at an accredited graduate school and not have been used to complete the requirements for a degree. • All credit to be transferred must fall within the time limit for the degree/certiﬁcate. • The student must have earned at least a grade of B (3.0) (or the equivalent) on all transfer credit. • The credit must be recorded on an ofﬁcial transcript placed on ﬁle with the Graduate School. • All credit must be approved both by the Graduate Program Director in the student’s academic program and by the Dean of the Graduate School. • Transfer credit must be necessary to meet speciﬁc degree requirements. Quarter-hours do not transfer as semester hours. A fraction of an hour of credit will not be transferred. See equivalent samples below: • 2 quarter hours transfer as 1 semester hour. • 3-4 quarter hours transfer as 2 semester hours. • 5 quarter hours transfer as 3 semester hours. • 6-7 quarter hours transfer as 4 semester hours. • 8 quarter hours transfer as 5 semester hours. • 9-10 quarter hours transfer as 6 semester hours. Upon recommendation by the student’s academic program, the Graduate School reviews requests for courses to be transferred for credit toward a graduate degree. Such work must represent graduate-level courses relevant to the degree being sought, with course content and level of instruction resulting in student competencies at least equivalent to those of currently enrolled students as determined by the academic program. Students seeking transfer credit should be prepared to submit a syllabus to their academic program. Undergraduate Courses Courses approved for undergraduate credit only (100-499), including required prerequisite courses, will not be counted toward academic program requirements, do not count toward full-time enrollment status, do not appear on the graduate transcript, and will not factor into the student’s GPA. These courses are ineligible for ﬁnancial aid. Auditing Courses To audit a course, students must obtain written permission of the course instructor and the academic program chair. Students can request this permission only after the end of the ofﬁcial registration period. Retroactive academic credit for an audited course is not permitted. If a student requires credit for a previously audited course, the student must enroll for the course and fulﬁll all assignment to receive a course grade and academic credit. Registration Status The Graduate School serves as the Dean’s Ofﬁce authorization for University Registrar forms. Full-Time Registration To be considered full-time, students must enroll in a minimum of nine (9) credit-earning graduate credit hours. There are two instances described below when a student enrolled for three (3) credits is awarded full-time status. Master’s and MFA - 3 Credits as Full-Time Status After completing all required course work, a master’s student may be considered full-time while enrolled in a 3-credit hour thesis course (699), DCE 697 or 698, or THE 699. Master’s students may maintain full-time status with 3 credits of 699 for two terms. Doctoral Candidacy - 3 Credits as Full-Time Status After entering candidacy status, a doctoral student is considered full-time while enrolled in 3 credits of dissertation (799). Doctoral candidates may  814 Graduate Policies maintain full-time status with 3 credits of dissertation enrollment until completion of the number of dissertation credit hours speciﬁed by their programs in the University Catalog. Extension Status Students who have already enrolled in the maximum number of 699/799 hours but who have not yet completed the requirements for thesis/ dissertation enter extension status. To maintain continuous enrollment, extension students are required to enroll in and pay for tuition and fees for at least one extension hour. The following applies to students in extension status: • Students must be enrolled in 9 credit-hours to be considered full-time. • The Graduate School will no longer contribute towards the UNCG sponsored health insurance. • Students may purchase this insurance if they are enrolled in at least one extension hour. • Students in extension status lose eligibility for all state-funded support but may be supported by external funds. Contact the Graduate School for more information on this option. Permission to enroll in extension courses will require veriﬁcation by the committee chair that the student is making satisfactory progress. These credit hours will not count toward the degree, may impact eligibility for federal ﬁnancial aid support, and may adversely impact loan repayment schedules. Ofﬁcial information may be found by clicking here (https:// studentaid.gov/manage-loans/lower-payments/get-temporary-relief/). Continuous Enrollment Students pursuing a graduate degree or certiﬁcate program are required to be enrolled from the time of matriculation through degree/certiﬁcate completion. Continuous enrollment is deﬁned as completing a minimum of one (1) hour of graduate credit (including 699/799/801/802/803) every fall and spring semester, or one semester during the academic year in combination with a summer session. This course work must be approved for the student’s program of study and selected in consultation with the departmental Graduate Program Director and/or advisor or committee chair. State funds may not be applied to support tuition for any course that is not documented on the student’s Plan of Study. All graduate students must be enrolled for at least 1 credit during the semester in which they are scheduled to receive their degrees/ certiﬁcates. This may include extension courses (801/802/803). Any student who breaks continuous enrollment must apply for re- admission to the university.  If re-admitted, the student will be assigned to the catalog requirements for the program in effect for the re-admit term. Visa Requirement for International Students Failure to maintain continuous and accurately reported full-time registration can have severe consequences, including, but not limited to, loss of visa status and deportation. Each term, the academic department must supply a letter to the International Programs Center verifying that the student remains in good standing and is making satisfactory progress toward completion of the degree. Ofﬁcial information on maintaining visa status is located here (https://international.uncg.edu/ international-students-and-scholars/degree-seeking-students/ maintaining-your-status/) in the International Programs Center. Please note: Certain restriction may apply on distance and online course enrollments. International students should consult with their graduate program with questions about maintaining full-time enrollment. Registration while on Assistantship or Fellowships Each student holding a service (assistantship) or non-service (fellowship) appointment must be registered full-time to hold that position during the fall and spring semesters. Faculty members who wish to request an exception to this requirement may do so by ﬁlling out the Reduced Course Load Request Form (https://grs.uncg.edu/faculty/). International students must also contact the International Program Center if they request a reduced course load. (See Section II: Financial and Employment Information and Regulations for more information.) Dissertation Registration Students may not register for dissertation (799) until they have achieved candidacy. Programs with documented external licensing or accreditation requirements that impact the normal progression to candidacy may be exempted from this requirement. Milestone Exam Registration Students must be registered in the semester any milestone exams are taken and graded; this is normally a fall or spring semester.  A student who registered full-time in the immediately preceding spring and upcoming fall terms may take comprehensive exams during the summer without registering for summer session. Students who are eligible to take exams over the summer should not expect to receive results of the exam until early in the fall semester. Changes to Registration The Graduate School serves as the Dean’s Ofﬁce authorization for University Registrar forms. Adding Courses Courses may be added only during the ofﬁcial add period. Please refer to the University Registrar’s Calendar for ofﬁcial add period dates for the standard semester and summer terms. In rare cases, the Graduate School may authorize a student to enroll in a course after the census date in a given term. Effective dates are not altered. For courses scheduled outside the standard term dates, proportional deadlines are similarly applied. Dropping Courses Drop deadlines for the standard semester and summer terms are given in the University Registrar’s Academic Calendar (https://reg.uncg.edu/ calendars/). To drop a course outside the normal drop period, the student must complete and obtain the required signatures on the registration drop/add from, available through the student’s academic program or the Graduate School.  For courses scheduled outside the standard term dates, proportional deadlines are similarly applied. No regularly scheduled course may be dropped in the last two weeks of classes in a fall or spring semester or during the last week of a summer session. For courses scheduled outside the standard term dates, proportional deadlines are similarly applied. Important note: Dropping a course after the census date may have ﬁnancial and academic consequences. Please refer to Financial Consequences of Academic Actions in Section II. A student registered for and wishing to drop an interinstitutional course follows the same procedures and deadlines as required for dropping courses at UNCG. Ofﬁcial withdrawal from the University is required if a student wishes to drop all courses after census date.  UNC Greensboro 2023-24 University Catalog 815 Independent Study Registration Independent study is reserved for degree-seeking students. Non-degree seeking and certiﬁcate students are not eligible to register for courses considered to be Directed Student Learning, (independent work with an instructor). No student may register for an Independent Directed Studies course as a substitute for existing courses. Degree-seeking students must have completed several regular courses of graduate work and be in academic good standing to be eligible for the course type IND (independent study). Registration for independent study must have the approval of the instructor, the Department Head, and the Dean of the Graduate School. Master’s students may register for no more than 3 credit hours of independent study per semester and may count no more than 6 credit hours of independent study toward satisfying the minimum requirements for the master’s degree. Doctoral, Doctoral Track, and M.F.A. students may count no more than 15 credits of independent study toward degree requirements. Cross Registration The Graduate School participates in the three interinstitutional agreements: • Interinstitutional Registration • the Greater Greensboro Consortium • UNC Online Students taking courses through a cross-registration agreement must meet the standards for participation in the program as set by their home institution, including the transfer credit policies of the Graduate School, and must follow the rules and policies of both campuses. Students must be registered for at least half of their hours at UNC Greensboro the same semester in which they register through either the Interinstitutional or the Consortium agreement. Under Interinstitutional Registration and the Greater Greensboro Consortium, enrollment and payment of tuition and fees take place on the home campus. For UNC Online, students must pay the appropriate tuition and fees to the visited institution. Courses taken through cross-registration are considered transfer credit and although the course title will appear on the student’s UNC Greensboro transcript, grades are not recorded or calculated into the student’s overall GPA. Regardless of modality, no cross-registered course may be taken pass/fail (satisfactory/unsatisfactory, etc.), and all courses must earn a speciﬁc grade to be eligible for transfer. Please refer to the Graduate Grading section of this Handbook for the policy concerning interinstitutional grading. Application forms and information are available at the Graduate School and the University Registrar’s Ofﬁce. The student must ﬁll complete the application form and obtain their Graduate Program Director’s signature certifying the following requirements: • an equivalent course is not available on this campus, • the course is appropriate for the student’s degree program, and • it is a graduate-level course according to the current numbering schemes in the visited institution’s catalog. Interinstitutional Registration The Interinstitutional Registration program with North Carolina State University, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, University of North Carolina at Charlotte, North Carolina Central University, and Duke University allows degree-seeking graduate students at UNC Greensboro, with the approval of Dean of the Graduate School and their Graduate Program Director, to take courses at these speciﬁc campuses. Eligible courses are limited to traditional, campus-based courses. Distance learning, extension, and online courses are not eligible through the interinstitutional agreement. Greater Greensboro Consortium Through membership in the Greater Greensboro Consortium (GGC), UNC Greensboro also participates in an open-access agreement with North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, High Point University, and Elon University. With permission of their Graduate Program Director and UNCG’s Dean of the Graduate School, degree-seeking students may register for campus-based courses at Consortium Schools. UNC Online Interinstitutional Agreement The UNC Online Interinstitutional Agreement allows degree-seeking graduate students at UNC Greensboro to take online courses at the 15 other UNC system schools. This requires approval by the Dean of the Graduate School and their Graduate Program Director. Students must pay the appropriate tuition and fees to the visited institution. Approved requests should be submitted through UNC Online (https:// online.northcarolina.edu/). Note: Courses taken through cross-registration with another institution are considered transfer credits. Grades do not appear on the UNC Greensboro transcript and are not calculated in the GPA. Cancellation of Registration The University will cancel registration under the following circumstances: Failure to Attend Students who did not attend or participate in any courses will have their registration cancelled. * If a student attended or participated in any portion of his/her courses, then Dropping Courses or ofﬁcial Withdrawal from the University processes should be followed. Appropriate justiﬁcation and approval by the academic program should be included with the cancellation request prior to submission for electronic processing by the Graduate School. Academic Ineligibility The Graduate School will automatically cancel the registration of those students who become academically ineligible. (See Eligibility to Remain in Graduate School.) Nonpayment of Tuition and Fees A student’s registration will be canceled if they do not pay tuition and fees (or properly arrange for a payment schedule) by the payment deadline given in the University Registrar’s Calendar. Failure to Submit Immunization Records North Carolina law requires immunization records. The Certiﬁcate of Immunization (https://shs.uncg.edu/wp-content/uploads/ MedicalHistoryForm_Spring2019.pdf) or record of immunization must be ﬁled within 30 days of ﬁrst registering for classes. All new, transfer, and readmitted students (who have not attended UNCG during the previous year) must submit a completed immunization record to Student Health Services to avoid registration cancellation.  816 Graduate Policies The Annual Immunization Report is done each fall. The statute applies to all students except students residing off-campus and registering for any combination of: • Off-campus courses • Evening courses (classes beginning after 5 p.m.) • Weekend courses • Enrollment in fewer than ﬁve credit-hours in Greensboro Campus courses that meet before 5p.m. For additional information about the University’s Cancellation policies (p. 850), please refer to the Ofﬁce of the University Registrar. Graduate Grading Permanent Grades Permanent grades include all grades except NR, IP and I. The distinction between permanent and temporary grades is used to regulate grade changes. Grading Scale for Permanent Course Grades Plus/minus grades are incorporated into the GPA for all graduate level courses according to the following scale: Grade Grade Points Awarded Per Hour of Credit A 4.0 A- 3.7 B+ 3.3 B 3.0 B- 2.7 C+ 2.3 C 2.0 F/WF 0.0 W 0.0 S/U 0.0 Grade Point Average (GPA) The grade point average is determined by dividing the accumulated number of grade points earned by the accumulated number of semester hours undertaken. Hours attempted but not passed must be included in this calculation. Courses graded S/U and courses transferred from another institution (except those courses taken through cross registration) may not be used in determining the UNC Greensboro grade point average. S-U Courses (Graduate) Grades for the following courses are reported as Satisfactory (S) or Unsatisfactory (U): • Thesis and dissertation courses upon completion (699, 799) • 800-level extension courses (801, 802, 803) • Other courses as indicated in the departmental listings Temporary Grades Not Reported (NR) The NR grade is assigned by the Registrar’s Ofﬁce in instances in which the instructor does not report a grade and the semester has ofﬁcially closed. Failure to submit a grade may cause a student to be placed on academic probation. All NR grades must be removed before ﬁnal degree clearance. Incomplete (I) The symbol I indicates inability, for reasons beyond the student’s control, to complete course requirements by the end of the term in which the course was offered. The Incomplete may be removed by completion of the deferred requirements within six months from the last day of examinations in the term in which the course was taken. An Incomplete not removed within this time limit automatically becomes an F. A grade of I in any course, including work not required for the student’s program, must be removed before graduation. A grade of I cannot be removed with a grade of W. In Progress (IP) Extension of thesis, research extension, and extension of dissertation courses may be graded with IP on a limited basis, but faculty advisers are required to provide documentation of the student’s satisfactory progress toward completion of the program. There are other courses that use this grade as well, typically courses that can extend beyond normal semester dates (e.g. an internship, practicum, etc.). In the case of a thesis, master’s production, or dissertation in progress, a grade of In Progress (IP) will be recorded each semester of registration for credit until successful completion of the thesis, master’s production, or dissertation, when a ﬁnal grade of Satisfactory (S) will be assigned. Cross-Institutional Grading For a cross-institutional course to apply as transfer credit towards a UNCG student’s graduate degree, the cross-institutional course may not be taken pass/fail. Grades earned for courses taken via cross- institutional registration do not factor into a student’s academic eligibility calculation. Grade Change Non-temporary course grades are permanent grades. A permanent grade change may be initiated only by the instructor and only in cases of arithmetic or clerical error, and then only with the approval of the department head of the instructor’s academic program. If a student receives a course grade other than incomplete (I), an instructor may not initiate a change of a course grade as a result of reevaluating the quality of the student's performance or as a result of additional work (whether that work is speciﬁed in the syllabus or not) performed by the student. Final approval resides with the Dean of the Graduate School. Such grade changes must be ﬁnalized no later than the last day of classes of the next succeeding fall or spring semester. Repeating a Course for Credit Except for independent study or where speciﬁc provision is made in the Catalog, no student may repeat for credit a course for which he/she has earned credit. If a student repeats such a course, the grade will be recorded on the transcript, but no additional credit will be allowed toward graduation. A failing grade remains on the student’s academic record permanently. Graduation and Commencement GPA Requirement for Graduation For the completion of graduate programs, the GPA for graduate courses taken since matriculation in the program must be at least 3.0, even if they  UNC Greensboro 2023-24 University Catalog 817 are not required on the Plan of Study. A higher GPA may be required in the major ﬁeld at the option of the major department. In the case of a student who has attempted the minimum number of credit hours for the degree or certiﬁcate without achieving the required GPA, the Dean of the Graduate School, upon the recommendation of the department, may permit the student to continue taking courses in an effort to earn the required minimum GPA. If permission is granted, a maximum of 25% of the course work hours required for the program may be added to the plan of study, not to exceed 12 credit hours. The additional credit hours may not be independent study. Commencement Ceremony Master’s students completing all degree requirements by the end of the spring semester are encouraged to participate in the May Commencement ceremony. Students completing all degree requirements by the end of the fall semester are encouraged to participate in the December Commencement ceremony. Students completing all degree requirements by the end of the Summer Session may participate in either the following December or May Commencement ceremony by applying before required due dates (see Graduate School calendar) to graduate, paying the graduation fee, and notifying the Graduate School. Degree candidates will not earn degrees nor be graduated from the University until they have completed all degree requirements. Participation in a commencement ceremony does not presume graduation from the University. Doctoral Hooding Ceremony Only those doctoral candidates who have successfully defended their dissertation may participate in the Doctoral Hooding Ceremony. Students defending in the spring semester are expected to participate in the May ceremony. Students defending in the fall semester are expected to participate in the December ceremony. Students completing all degree requirements by the end of the Summer Session may participate in either the following December or following May ceremony. Students must apply before required due dates (see Academic Calendars) to graduate, pay the graduation fee, and notify the Graduate School. Students who plan to defend after the cut-off date for graduation may apply to participate in that semester’s hooding ceremony but will not be listed in the program. These students will be listed in the commencement program during the semester in which they complete all degree requirements. Participation in the hooding ceremony does not presume graduation from the University. Doctoral candidates will not earn degrees nor be graduated from the University until they have completed all degree requirements. Applying for Graduation Students may not be admitted to and graduate from the same degree program in the same academic term. However, students who are in academic good standing in a degree program may be admitted to and graduate from a concurrent certiﬁcate program in the same academic term. Students must formally apply for graduation (or to participate in the doctoral hooding ceremony) to the Graduate School by the end of the ﬁrst week of classes during the term in which they plan to graduate. Degrees are awarded at the end of each semester and the second summer session (i.e., in December, May, and August). All graduate students must be enrolled for at least one credit during the term in which they are scheduled to receive their degree. This may include extension courses (801, 802, 803). (See the Continuous Enrollment policy under Registration Status in Section I.) Diplomas and transcripts of students owing money to the University will be withheld until their account is cleared. Students may not be admitted to and graduate from the same degree in the same academic term. However, students who are currently enrolled in a degree-seeking program, may apply to and graduate from a certiﬁcate program. Students who do not apply for graduation before the published deadline for any semester may apply for graduation during the next semester. Students who have applied for graduation but fail to meet the requirements must reapply for graduation by the published deadline for the semester in which they will fulﬁll the requirements. Degrees are conferred only after all requirements are completed and the Board of Trustees has taken ofﬁcial action. Graduation Fee The graduation fee is payable in the Cashier’s and Student Accounts Ofﬁce. Students who do not graduate in the term for which they originally applied must ﬁle a new application but will not be assessed an additional fee. Students should contact the Graduate School regarding status. Degree Name Changes In the event that the name of a degree changes after a student graduates, graduates will be awarded a degree by UNC Greensboro with the ofﬁcial name and credential of the academic program’s degree at the time of graduation and will not be able to change that degree at a later date if ofﬁcially changed by the University. Medical or Personal Issues Leave of Absence UNC Greensboro supports a leave of absence policy to assist graduate students who are temporarily unable to continue their programs. The leave of absence may extend for up to one academic year. Current students who must break continuous enrollment may apply for a leave of absence. Students choosing this option must ﬁle a Graduate School Request for a Leave of Absence that states the reason for the requested absence and that they will neither use University resources, nor require faculty communication or interaction during the leave period. If the leave of absence extends beyond one academic year, the student's matriculation is closed, and the student must re-apply for admission to the Graduate School. International students who wish to apply for a leave of absence are advised to consult with the International Program Center before submitting the Request for a Leave of Absence with the Graduate School. It is the student’s responsibility to ensure that the proposed leave is compatible with the regulations of any granting agency from which funding would normally be received during the leave period and that such agencies are informed of the proposed leave. Students on student loan programs should inquire with the Financial Aid Ofﬁce and/or lender regarding any consequences that such a leave may have on their ability to receive future aid or on their repayment status. Graduate students on assistantship, who are granted a leave of absence, will have their salary and stipend suspended during the period of their leave. If feasible, the remainder of their appointment will be held for them upon their return to the next term. If a graduate assistant and Graduate Program Director disagree on the leave or its arrangements, students  818 Graduate Policies may appeal to the Graduate School. (See Appeals for Academic Decisions under Student Rights, Responsibilities, and Registration in Section I.) Preparing the Application for Leave of Absence In consultation with the supervising faculty member, the Application for Leave of Absence form is to be completed by the student and signed by both the student and the advisor or supervising faculty member. The application is to be submitted to the Graduate Program Director for review and signature before being forwarded to the Dean of the Graduate School. Whenever possible, application should be made in advance of the anticipated leave or as soon as possible after commencement of the leave. Withdrawal from the University or a Course Graduate students who must withdraw from the University for any reason may do so by dropping all courses online through UNCGenie until the last day to drop without academic penalty. Course withdrawals that occur after this date are automatically assigned a WF grade, which is calculated as an F (failing) grade. Students whose registration for all courses is cancelled by the University must seek reactivation or readmission through the Graduate School to return to school in subsequent terms. Withdrawal After Drop Deadline Due to Extenuating Circumstances Graduate students with appropriate cause as determined by ofﬁcially documented military deployment, medical, psychological, or unanticipated personal life events, or administrative reasons, may petition the Graduate School for an exemption from the published Withdrawal from a Program or a Course Policy. The Graduate School shall be responsible for authorizing exemption requests in consultation with the instructor of every course, and with other departments or agencies as needed. If a Course Withdrawal Request After the Drop Deadline is authorized, all requested courses will be indicated on the transcript with a grade of W. A course abandoned with insufﬁcient reason for withdrawal is assigned the grade of F. In certain cases, faculty may initiate the withdrawal procedure for cause. If a student withdraws from all courses, the student is considered ofﬁcially withdrawn from the university. Retroactive Withdrawal Policy In very rare cases, students who have experienced extenuating circumstances may request to retroactively withdraw from all courses in a term up to one year following the term in which the courses were taken. Students may not request to withdraw from speciﬁc courses; the request to withdraw must be for all courses a student enrolled in for the requested withdrawal term. If a Retroactive Withdrawal Request is approved,  the student will be withdrawn from all courses in the requested term and receive W grades on their transcript for those courses. A grade of W will not negatively affect GPA or academic standing at the University. In accordance with the Academic Integrity Policy, a request to retroactively withdraw from courses will not be approved for a course(s) in which an academic integrity violation has resulted in a F grade. Students must initiate the Retroactive Withdrawal Request by contacting the Graduate School. Health Insurance Plans As stipulated by the UNC Board of Governors, all students enrolled at UNCG are required to have veriﬁable health insurance coverage. To ensure that this requirement is met, all students will automatically be billed for the Student Health Insurance Plan (SHIP) each semester through their Student Account. Students who have a creditable health insurance plan and do not wish to participate in SHIP must submit their active health insurance information by completing an on-line waiver request through the Student Blue portal prior to the posted deadline each semester. A student who fails to submit a waiver request is required to pay the amount posted to their account. Criteria for Graduate Students to be Eligible for SHIP • Enrolled in a degree-seeking program • Enrolled in one (1) or more credit hours, including extension credit. (Online Program students are not eligible for the plan.) Conflict of Interest Student-Faculty Relationship It is essential to the promotion of high academic standards and maintenance of sound professional practice that the student-faculty relationship be free of real or apparent conflicts of interest based on familial relationships. To this end, a member of the faculty shall not serve in any capacity that will involve evaluating the academic performance of a graduate student when there exists between them a relationship in the ﬁrst or second degree of afﬁnity or consanguinity or when they otherwise are so closely identiﬁed with one another as to suggest a possible conflict of interest. Students as Faculty Graduate students should not be assigned to graduate assistantships that generate conflicts of interest. Graduate students may not teach any course at the 500-level or higher. A student pursuing a graduate degree at this institution may not be appointed as a member of the General Faculty, except under both of the following conditions: • the appointment begins in the same semester that the degree is awarded. • the conditions of employment are approved by the Graduate School, the Department Head and Unit Dean, of the program in which the student is pursuing a degree, and the employing academic Department Head and Unit Dean, if appropriate. Graduate students should not be assigned as an instructional assistant for any course at the 500-level or higher. In these situations, the Graduate Program Director must ﬁle the Conflict of Interest Form with the Graduate School for evaluation. Graduate students normally do not teach other graduate students from the same academic program. However, there are times when a graduate student must enroll in an undergraduate pre-requisite course with another graduate student serving as Instructor of Record. In these situations, the Graduate Program Director must ﬁle the Conflict of Interest Form with the Graduate School for evaluation. In such cases, a full-time faculty member must be designated as the graduate student’s teaching supervisor and be responsible for grading the graduate student’s work.  UNC Greensboro 2023-24 University Catalog 819 Section II: Financial and Employment Information and Regulations Tuition and Other Charges Tuition for Graduate Students All students must pay tuition and fees according to the schedule printed in the University Registrar’s Calendar unless they qualify for a deferment. Refer to the University Cashier’s Ofﬁce for current cost of attendance information. Financial aid cannot be used to satisfy balances carried forward from a prior academic year. Residence Status for Tuition Payment As a state-supported institution, the tuition rate for legal residents of North Carolina is less than the tuition rate for nonresidents. All students claiming North Carolina residency must ﬁle through the North Carolina’s Residency Determination Service (https://ncresidency.cfnc.org/ residencyInfo/). Students classiﬁed as in-state pay only the resident tuition rate. Students classiﬁed as out-of-state pay the out-of-state differential and the resident tuition. Information regarding residency requirements is also available on the Residency Determination Service website. A new application for residence status for tuition purposes may need to be submitted with all reapplication or readmission requests. Fees for Graduate Students University fees support non-academic services for students. The University works to keep fees competitive with peer institutions and only charges students what is defensible in covering costs associated with the services provided. For a list of required fees for graduate students, see the Cashier’s and Student Accounts Ofﬁce (https://csh.uncg.edu/). All graduate students are responsible for paying student fees. Payment methods The Cashier’s and Student Accounts Ofﬁce (https://csh.uncg.edu/) details student billing information, payment due dates and methods, payment plans, and fees. Graduate assistants are eligible for the payment plans that are described on the Accounting Services website under Payment Plans (https://csh.uncg.edu/payment-plan-information/). Late registration service charge A student has not completed registration until all required steps have been taken, including payment of tuition and fees. Any student failing to complete registration on the published deadline dates will incur a late enrollment charge. See the Registrar’s Registration Guide (https:// reg.uncg.edu/registration/) for deadlines. Past due accounts Any indebtedness to the University which becomes past due immediately jeopardizes the student’s enrollment, and no such student will be permitted to enroll for an ensuing semester or summer term. Billing fees and/or collection costs may be added to the indebtedness. Further, any student who fails to pay all indebtedness to the University, including collection costs, may not be issued a transcript or diploma. Unresolved debts may be turned over to a collection agency, reported to a credit bureau, and/or deducted from state income tax refunds. Debts include, but are not limited to, parking violations, library ﬁnes, residence hall fees, academic fees, and others. Disputed settlements of University fees, returned checks, EFTs, and credit card payments are determined by the Cashiers Ofﬁce. Refunds Refunds of tuition and fees, and the policies governing them, are described on the Refunds (https://spartancentral.uncg.edu/tuition-billing- payments/refunds/) page, with additional details at the Student Financial Services page. Doctoral Student Status Doctoral Students are placed in one of three categories, pre-candidate, candidates, or extension. Graduate School Beneﬁts are different for each status. Assistantships The term Graduate Assistant is the umbrella term that encompasses all types of graduate student service appointments. All assistantships are administered by individual units (departments, colleges, centers, etc.). Any student interested in an appointment as a graduate assistant should make direct contact with the department, college, or unit of interest. Each unit may have deadlines for applying for positions and/or speciﬁc requirements for the assistantship. Students may also consult the Graduate Assistantship Applications listed in UNCG Human Resources Spartan Talent search postings found here (https://spartantalent.uncg.edu/postings/search/). All policies on graduate teaching assistants adhere to the UNC System policy Guidelines on Training, Monitoring, and Evaluating Graduate Teaching Assistants (https://www.northcarolina.edu/apps/policy/) (400.3.5.1[G]). Acceptance of an Offer of Financial Support UNCG is a member of the Council of Graduate Schools and adheres to the following resolution:* Acceptance of an offer of ﬁnancial support* (such as a graduate scholarship, fellowship, traineeship, or assistantship) for the next academic year by a prospective or enrolled graduate student completes an agreement that both student and graduate school expect to honor. In that context, the conditions affecting such offers and their acceptance must be deﬁned carefully and understood by all parties. Students are under no obligation to respond to offers of ﬁnancial support prior to April 15# earlier deadlines for acceptance of such offers violate the intent of this Resolution. In those instances in which a student accepts an offer before April 15, and subsequently desires to withdraw that acceptance, the student may submit in writing a resignation of the appointment at any time through April 15. However, an acceptance given or left in force after April 15 commits the student not to accept another offer without ﬁrst obtaining a written release from the institution to which a commitment has been made. Similarly, an offer by an institution after April 15 is conditional on presentation by the student of the written release from any previously accepted offer. It is further agreed by the institutions and organizations subscribing to the above Resolution that a copy of this Resolution or a link to the URL should accompany every scholarship, fellowship, traineeship, and assistantship offer. ~ Council of Graduate Schools, Resolution Regarding Graduate Scholars, Fellows, Trainees and Assistants. Renewed October 2014.*  820 Graduate Policies * This resolution applies to offers of ﬁnancial support only, not offers of admission. Eligibility for Graduate Assistantships UNC Greensboro recognizes that Graduate Assistants are students ﬁrst; Graduate Assistants have remunerated responsibilities to the institution, but those duties should support the educational aspirations of the student’s academic program. To qualify for a graduate assistantship, students must be admitted and enrolled full-time in a graduate degree program. Students who are employed in full-time positions either inside or outside the University are not eligible for assistantships. The primary objective for graduate assistants is to pursue their individual course of study. However, these students are also employed by the University to teach, conduct research, or assist with administrative duties. Graduate assistantships are mutually beneﬁcial to both students and the University. Assignments should be directly related to the student’s ﬁeld of study or provide the opportunity to develop transferable, professional skills. Graduate Student Assistantships beneﬁt the student by providing: • ﬁnancial assistance to graduate students while they pursue their degree • teaching and research experience for graduate students • training in high impact practices in pedagogy • opportunities to develop professional skills Graduate Student Assistantships beneﬁt the university by providing: • instruction for critical teaching needs • research support for our research active faculty • administrative support for many areas of the university in support of our mission Regardless of the source of funding, the responsibility for administering all graduate student ﬁnancial support resides in the Graduate School in the ofﬁce of the Dean of the Graduate School. The Graduate School closely monitors the state dollars budgeted as tuition support. Units are solely responsible for supplying stipend funds. Units may also provide additional tuition support to that allocated by the Graduate School or may supplement the Graduate School’s contribution towards student eligibility for health insurance support. Open Graduate Assistantships are expected to be used to recruit new students to UNCG. In the case of a documented retention issue, or an identiﬁed personnel need, please contact the Graduate School. Types of Appointments The term Graduate Assistant is the umbrella term that encompasses all types of graduate student appointments. The following titles are used for graduate students at UNCG to help identify those students with duties that require higher levels of experience for the position held. (SACSCOC) Graduate Assistants who serve in multiple capacities should be given the title representing the preponderance of the assigned work. In all cases, a student who is serving as an Instructor of Record must be assigned as a Graduate Teaching Associate (GTA). Graduate Teaching Associate The Graduate Teaching Associate (GTA) is a graduate student, enrolled in accordance with their plan of study, who serves as Instructor of Record for an undergraduate course in the discipline. The Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC) requires that all Graduate Instructors of Record (GTA) have “earned at least 18 graduate semester hours in their teaching discipline, be under the direct supervision of a faculty member experienced in the teaching discipline, receive regular in-service training and be evaluated regularly”. This student has full responsibility for a course, including leading the class and assigning grades. Associates may also lead discussion sections, grade papers and exams, or supervise laboratory sections. Graduate Teaching Associates may NOT teach graduate-level courses. Graduate Instructional Assistant The Graduate Instructional Assistant (GIA) is a graduate student, enrolled in accordance with their plan of study, who may assist with grading and other administrative responsibilities related to a course, but they are not responsible for ﬁnal grades. GIAs may be listed in the schedule for labs, recitations, tutorials, etc. that are linked to a course with a credentialed Instructor of Record. These courses are designated with an R or an L after the course number and are linked to the Lecture course taught by the faculty member. This may include lab assistance and set-up, serving as a lab supervisor, meeting students in ofﬁce hours or group settings to provide tutorial assistance, lead recitation sections, or other duties, but does not deliver new course content. GIAs serve under the direct supervision of the faculty member who is instructor of record and a member of the graduate faculty, participates in pre-service training, and receives regular in-service training as well as planned, periodic evaluations. Graduate Research Assistant The Graduate Research Assistant (GRA) is a graduate student, enrolled in accordance with their plan of study and assigned to work in a faculty member's lab or provide fundamental support for a faculty member’s research. The supervising faculty member may or may not be the student's main advisor. Duties of research assistants vary by discipline and lab but include all tasks needed to pursue research in a given area, such as: data collection, entry, and analysis; reviewing the literature and other library work; writing reports; copying, ﬁling, and collating; organizing and/or cleaning the lab or ofﬁce. Graduate Clinical Assistant The Graduate Clinical Assistant (GCA) is a graduate student, enrolled in accordance with their plan of study and engaged in clinical teaching, research, or clinical practice under the supervision of or in collaboration with a member of the graduate faculty. These students may be assigned case-loads, group counseling, crisis intervention, outreach programming, personality assessments, maintaining clinical records, or other clinical duties as assigned. Graduate Ofﬁce Assistant The Graduate Ofﬁce Assistant (GOA) is the title given to graduate assistants when there are no expectations of classroom teaching or grading. This individual may staff an open laboratory, studio, or workshop, where students complete assignments or work on projects; provide non-graded, individual instruction or tutoring; or help faculty prepare and manage classroom materials. The ofﬁce assistant may also perform academic duties such as assisting in non-central roles of faculty research.  An ofﬁce assistant may also be assigned to a wide variety of other responsibilities that are not related to instructional or research processes but support the mission of the University. Graduate students  UNC Greensboro 2023-24 University Catalog 821 who have appointments in non-academic units are always classiﬁed as ofﬁce assistants. The Graduate School reserves the right to withdraw an assistantship appointment at any time because of failure to meet basic eligibility requirements, including maintaining adequate academic performance (3.0 GPA) and satisfactory progress toward degree, or for violation of University policies. Units may also withdraw an assistantship based on failure to follow guidelines or for substandard performance in assistantship duties. Graduate Assistant Training Hundreds of graduate students serve as teaching or lab assistants or graders each semester, supporting the mission of excellent undergraduate education at UNCG. To ensure high-quality experiences for undergraduates as well as our new teaching associates and instructional assistants, the Graduate School requires each student appointed as grader, lab assistant, instructional assistant, clinical assistant, or graduate instructor of record to attend Graduate Assistantship Training. This comprises a series of online tutorials to be completed over the summer and a full-day workshop on the Monday the semester opens. These are appointments as GTA, GIA, and GCA. If a GRA is working with undergraduate students in any capacity, they are required to take the online training. The Graduate School’s program covers pedagogy, University Policies, (e.g., FERPA, Title IX, access and equity, etc.), mentoring students from diverse backgrounds, knowledge of human development appropriate to instructing undergraduate students, assessment, and other areas the faculty deem important. Waivers requesting a student be exempt from or delay training may be considered in unusual circumstances. Approval of the Unit Dean (or designee) and Graduate School Dean is required. Training for newly assigned GTAs and GIAs occurs on the Monday before classes begin each fall. Programs may require additional teaching assistant training that is more speciﬁc to the discipline. The Graduate School maintains an active roster of all students who have successfully completed Assistantship Training. Credentialing Process for Graduate Teaching Associates SACSCOC requires that Instructors of Record be credentialed by the course. The GPD must ﬁle the initial credentialing form no later than the start of the semester before a Graduate Teaching Associate may be added to the schedule of courses. Any time a Graduate Teaching Associate receives a new course assignment, the GPD must credential that student for the new assignment. Departments are expected to maintain accurate records documenting the SACSCOC mandated faculty supervision and observations. Graduate Instructional Assistants do not need to be credentialed, but they must attend mandatory TA training. To credential a Graduate Teaching Associate, click http://go.uncg.edu/gta- credentialing (http://go.uncg.edu/gta-credentialing/). Appointment Process All appointments for assistantships must be processed at least annually through the Graduate School. Selection of assistantship recipients, notiﬁcation of the appointment, duration, and the stipend amount are the responsibilities of the department or unit making the offer. The appointing unit must use the approved graduate assistantship hiring proposal in Spartan Talent. The hiring proposal must include a clear description of the expectations of the assistantship, the anticipated beginning and ending dates (not more than 12 months per appointment letter), stipend amount, average hours of service per week, the work schedule (where appropriate), and the conditions for reappointment, if any. In addition, the graduate assistant must be apprised of the ﬁnancial penalties related to academic fees that may be incurred if the assistantship starts after the beginning of the semester or is terminated before the end of the semester or session. Units making the appointment may include an attachment to the standard hiring proposal where it is necessary to specify duties and other requirements and terms of the appointment but may not alter the language of the standard hiring proposal. Where students are to be continued (reappointed) for the next ﬁscal/ academic year, each contract should be revised to reflect expectations for the coming year starting each July 1 (or in the case of appointments of less than 12 months, the start of the contract). Specifying duties Work assignments for students should be clear and speciﬁc and should reflect a relationship to the student’s academic program. Duties to be accomplished by any graduate assistant must be agreed upon in writing by the student and the faculty advisor (or supervisor). At no time may a graduate assistant receive academic credit for the work assigned for the assistantship. Supervisors should make a clear distinction between the work to be performed for the assistantship and the work being performed toward completing the degree. For example, it would be unusual for time spent completing class assignments to be part of the duties of an assistantship. Hours spent on thesis or dissertation research would not routinely be considered part of assistantship duties unless the research and the assistantship are part of an externally funded research project and that research directly supports the work of the project. Where duties require students to work outside the hours typically expected according to the appropriate University calendar (e.g., nights, weekends, holidays), the appointment letter should speciﬁcally describe these expectations. Maximum work hours A typical graduate assistantship will require an average of 15–20 hours of service per week and this must be clearly described in the appointment letter. Projected hours per week should be in line with the stipend. To remain in compliance with the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), the Graduate School recommends that students should not normally conduct service work (research or teaching assistantships) more than 20 hours per week. This recommendation enables them to work on their own studies and research for at least the remaining 20-hours per work week. Requests for hours above 20 require approval from the Dean of the Graduate School. In no case will students be permitted to conduct service work on campus for pay more than 29 hours per week. Graduate Program Directors in each graduate program are best informed to make these service assignments on an individual basis and should be responsible for monitoring that service expectations do not impede any student’s signiﬁcant progress toward their degree. A student may have multiple graduate assistantships or hourly appointments by the University; however, it is the responsibility of the secondary employer to receive permission of the primary employer and the Graduate School prior to assignment of any additional work, and to  822 Graduate Policies ensure that the maximum work load of 29 hours per week (20 hours per week for F-1 visa holders) is not exceeded. Graduate assistants are not permitted to accept off-campus employment without permission from the Graduate Program Director and Dean of the Graduate School. Graduate Assistants requesting to work more than 20 hours per week must ﬁll-out the Exemption to 20-hours Requirement form. Work calendar, University holidays, and leave Graduate assistants are expected to develop a plan with the department of employment in which they will meet the service obligation to which they have agreed.  As with all professional employees, graduate students are expected to communicate with their employer in a timely manner if absences occur or if they are unable to fulﬁll their responsibilities. Graduate assistants will be expected to work their average hours during the typical nine-month Academic Calendar, including during the exam period. Graduate assistants holding nine-month appointments are entitled to the ofﬁcial University holidays and/or breaks accorded nine-month faculty. Graduate assistants with 12-month appointments are entitled to the ofﬁcial University holidays accorded to 12-month administrative staff. Graduate assistants are not required to work during the following circumstances: • Fall Break, Spring Break and the holiday break between fall and spring semesters • State holidays such as Thanksgiving (Thursday and Friday), Memorial Day, 4th of July, Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, etc. • When the university is ofﬁcially closed for emergencies Any expected deviation from the typical calendar must be speciﬁed in the offer (e.g., being present to feed lab animals during holidays, working on weekends or at night, etc.) Graduate assistants do not accrue leave. They are expected to work typical hours per week according to the calendar speciﬁed by their program. Leave without pay Graduate assistants may request up to four weeks of leave without pay per semester and one week of leave without pay per summer session for illness of a close family member, death in the immediate family, or personal illness or hardship. If leave without pay is not approved by the supervisor of the graduate assistantship, the graduate assistant may petition the Dean of the Graduate School for approval. Parental leave A graduate assistant is eligible for up to six weeks of parental leave. The request for parental leave must be made to the department at least one month in advance, with notiﬁcation provided by the department chair to the Dean of the Graduate School. The Graduate School encourages the department and student to work together to enable the student to maintain enrollment and employment status during this time. The Graduate School can help explore options on an individual basis. Stipends At no time may a graduate assistant be paid less than the North Carolina Minimum Wage. The Graduate School does not currently regulate or cap assistantships as long as they exceed the minimum threshold. We expect that stipends should be commensurate with market, experience, and skills, and should be equitable with other stipends within the department that involve similar responsibilities. Payroll, I-9, and First Day of Work Graduate assistantships typically start at the opening of the semester, usually a week before classes begin. However, there may be good reasons why an assistantship should start before the semester begins, such as to provide preparation time for teaching a class, to provide training, to accommodate the timeline of a research project, to address administrative tasks that need to be completed prior to the start of the semester, etc. Appointments for new fall semester assistantships may therefore start as early as July 1. Regardless of start date, a student may neither begin a work assignment, nor be added to payroll unless an I-9 is on ﬁle. Continuing graduate students enrolled and employed in the spring, who plan to continue their education in the fall, can remain in a student worker status during the summer, employed as either a graduate assistant or graduate hourly. Important Note: The start of the fall semester (August Payroll) is the busiest time of the year to process payroll. Students assigned a start date and the student produces the mandatory I-9 prior to August 5 of any given year, that graduate assistant will not receive a paycheck until the end of September. A new incoming graduate student may be hired as a temporary employee student prior to July 1. On July 1, that student will convert to Graduate Assistant status. Fees as a graduate assistant A student on an assistantship must pay fees for graduate students as listed on the Cashier’s Webpage. Student Responsibilities to Maintain a Graduate Assistantship Minimum enrollment To hold a graduate assistantship, a student must maintain full-time status. (Faculty advisors may request an exception to this policy by clicking here (https://forms.gle/EcGFhx39ZnR9Q1GM9/).) Students on assistantship are not required to enroll in summer courses. • Undergraduate courses required by the program of study will not be considered to satisfy this requirement. • The Graduate School reserves the right to disallow a student who is not enrolled full-time to receive an assistantship. • Summer school is not supported by state appropriations; therefore, no tuition support is available for summer enrollment, nor are students expected to enroll. Performance and good standing To remain eligible to continue receiving assistantship support, students must be in compliance with all policies contained in the Graduate School Policies & Procedures section of the Catalog and policies from the department/program awarding the assistantship. • Students must maintain minimum enrollment levels, maintain at least a 3.0 GPA, make satisfactory progress toward the degree, perform at a high level in the assistantship duties, and follow all other expectations of conduct appropriate to a graduate student.  UNC Greensboro 2023-24 University Catalog 823 • Failure to comply with these expectations can result in loss of support and other sanctions outlined in the Catalog. Conduct, ethical, and integrity violations can lead to immediate termination of the assistantship as well as other sanctions outlined in the Catalog. Health Insurance Contribution As determined by the UNC Board of Governors, all students enrolled at UNCG are required to have veriﬁable health insurance coverage.  Students who have private health insurance should visit Student Blue (https:// shs.uncg.edu/student-insurance/) for information on opting out of the UNCG Plan. Graduate Assistants who receive the minimum stipends listed below AND are receiving full tuition support are eligible for a Graduate School contribution towards their premium if they have elected NC Student Blue. The amount available fluctuates each year. Minimum Stipend Levels to Trigger Health Insurance Support • $6,000 per year for Master’s students • $8,000 per year for MFA students • $9,700 per year for Doctoral students Renewal of Assistantships Although programs try to support graduate students through the average length of program, graduate assistants have no right to continuing support beyond the term of a current appointment. Renewal of an assistantship can only occur where funds are available, and where performance during the prior appointment has been reviewed and found to be acceptable. When graduate assistants are not performing within acceptable standards, we encourage supervisors to communicate feedback to students in writing early and often during the appointment. Because graduate students often rely upon support from assistantships, it is ideal to communicate intent to renew or to not renew an assistantship as early as is practical. International Student Employment International graduate students are required to hold proper immigration status before any assistantship can be paid or attending beneﬁts ensue. Special employment regulations for international students are governed by the Code of Federal Regulations and the Department of Homeland Security/U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). To ensure compliance with the Code of Federal Regulations, detailed information about international student employment and procedures for applying are available in the International Programs Center (https:// international.uncg.edu/). Speaking Proﬁciency for International Graduate Teaching Associates UNCG complies with North Carolina System requirements to assure that all instructional activities are conducted by individuals possessing appropriate proﬁciency in written and oral use of the English language. Instructional activities include lectures, recitation or discussion sessions, and laboratories. The individuals to be certiﬁed include graduate students for whom English is not the ﬁrst language. (See English Proﬁciency under International Applicants in Section I.) Social Security Card for International Students Every student with an F student visa or M student visa who is granted employment authorization by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (https://www.uscis.gov/) (USCIS), needs a Social Security Number. For information on how to apply for a Social Security Number, click here (https://studyinthestates.dhs.gov/obtaining-a-social- security-number/). International Students shall not begin work until they have obtained a Social Security Number and produced this for I-9 veriﬁcation. Please visit the International Program Center (https:// international.uncg.edu/international-students-and-scholars/) for more information. New international graduate assistants assigned as an instructor of record may not be eligible to work at the start of the semester. The student should notify their supervisor if there is need to cover instructional duties for a short period of time. Hourly Off-Campus Employment for International Students Permission for off-campus employment must ﬁrst be requested through the International Programs Center. Off-campus employment generally is unavailable to international students during the ﬁrst academic year and should not be considered as a means of ﬁnancial support. Students with F-1 visas may apply to the USCIS for limited off-campus work authorization after their ﬁrst year of study. Fellowships Fellowships are monetary awards that require no service or work from the student. Fellowships may be institutionally awarded (through the Graduate School or through one of UNCG’s graduate programs) or they may be externally awarded and brought to UNCG. Fellowships are awarded by government agencies (federal, state, local), private foundations, industries, professional groups, and others. The Graduate School maintains a list of available fellowships on its website that includes information on many prominent external fellowships. Students do not apply for UNCG Graduate School Fellowships; they are nominated for consideration by faculty. Typically, fellowships are awarded on merit and some require demonstrated ﬁnancial need. Unless otherwise stipulated by the grantor and/or donor, holders of fellowships or traineeships are required to maintain full-time status. Fellowship recipients are eligible for appointment as graduate assistants. For students simultaneously holding fellowships or traineeships and assistantships, the normal department stipend should be provided. The non-service fellowship is in addition to the stipend. Most UNCG Graduate School Fellowships are for one year only. Departments may request that the total amount of the fellowship be paid out over a speciﬁed number of years. Fellowships may be withdrawn at any time for failure to maintain satisfactory academic status or for violating University policies. Please see the Graduate School Webpage on Fellowships (https:// grs.uncg.edu/ﬁnancial/fellowships/). Tax liability Tax laws change every year and in unpredictable ways, at both the federal and state/local level. Students receiving any ﬁnancial aid, including assistantships and fellowships, fee waivers, and other support, should  824 Graduate Policies consult a qualiﬁed tax liability tax advisor. The Internal Revenue Service offers guidelines for tax responsibility for fellowship and other stipend awards under the topics “Scholarships, Fellowship Grants, Grants, and Tuition Reductions” (for U.S. citizen students) and under the topic “Taxation of Non-resident Aliens” (for non-U.S. citizen students). The Graduate School is not authorized to provide tax advice. Tuition Support Requests for tuition remission and in-state tuition awards are initiated by the academic program in which the student is enrolled. Tuition remission and in-state tuition awards are available fall and spring semesters only. No summer awards are made. Units making GA appointments may, at their discretion, recommend partial tuition support in proportion to the hours worked (e.g., a 10- hour assistantship may be assigned a 50% tuition award; a 15-hour assistantship may be assigned a 75% award, etc.). This must be communicated as part of the hiring proposal and contained in the appointment letter signed by the student. Out-of-State Students Out-of-State students must be awarded a fellowship or assistantship appointment of at least $2,000 to be eligible for a Tuition Remission Award, which reduces tuition to in-state rates. If awarded, the out-of-state tuition differential will be paid on the student’s behalf for the ﬁrst year of an assistantship. Students are expected to make a good faith effort to obtain NC residency by the end of the ﬁrst year. International students on an F1 Visa are exempt from this expectation. Out-of-State students who are awarded a Tuition Remission Award may also be eligible for an In-State Tuition Award. The combination of these two awards covers all tuition, but students remain responsible for University fees. Out-of-State students may not be awarded an In-State Tuition Award unless they have already been awarded a Tuition Remission Award. In-State students In-State students are not required to hold an assistantship or fellowship appointment to be eligible for an In-State Tuition Award. The amount awarded may range from covering the cost of 1 credit hour through full-time. The amount indicated on the hiring proposal is placed on the students account. If a student registers for more credits than the award covers, the student will be billed for the difference. These are non-service awards. Additional ﬁnancial policies and procedures can be found on our Financial Information (https://grs.uncg.edu/ﬁnancial/) website. Eligibility Students must meet the following criteria to qualify for tuition remission and/or in-state tuition awards: 1.  Students must be degree-seeking and full-time. Certiﬁcate students are ineligible. 2.  Out-of-State Students enrolled in doctoral, doctoral track, or stand- alone master’s programs must receive at least the state-mandated minimum stipend of $2,000. 3. Students must maintain academic good standing, 3.0 GPA or above. Important note: Students determined at any point in the semester to no longer meet the eligibility requirements to receive a tuition remission and/or in-state tuition award will have the full amount of any tuition remission and/or in-state tuition award rescinded and are then personally responsible for paying the full cost of tuition for that semester. Duration of Graduate School Support • Stand-alone master’s program students should not expect tuition remission and/or in-state tuition awards beyond four semesters. • MFA students should not expect tuition support beyond the expected number of semesters to completion. Some programs are four semesters, others six semesters. • Doctoral students (or students in doctoral track sequence programs) should not expect tuition remission and/or in-state tuition awards beyond ten semesters. (Departments with students who complete a stand-alone master’s program and are subsequently admitted to a doctoral program may petition the Graduate School for additional semesters of support.) Individual programs are permitted to grant additional semesters of tuition support provided Graduate School funding sources are not used. Semesters in which the student does not receive a tuition award from the Graduate School do not count toward the semester limits. Students who are enrolled in an academic program, do not complete the degree, and later enroll in a different program are only eligible for the maximum semesters of eligibility as noted above during their enrollment at the University. Financial Consequences of Academic Actions Termination of Assistantships Termination of an assistantship is different than non-renewal. Non- renewal of an assistantship refers to a situation in which a student completes an appointment and is not offered another. Termination of an assistantship refers to a situation where an assistantship is ended prior to the end of the appointment. Termination may be initiated by the Department, the Graduate School, or the student. Termination of an assistantship can have signiﬁcant and permanent consequences for a student and should only be undertaken after clear feedback on deﬁciencies and attempts to assist the student in meeting expectations. Financial Liability From Loss of Assistantship Stipend payments will cease immediately upon termination of an assistantship, regardless of the reason for termination. Any pay received erroneously more than the contracted amount or after termination of the assistantship must be returned to UNC Greensboro. Students who have received a tuition remission and/or in-state tuition award who resign or are terminated from their University assistantship prior to the end of the semester (for personal, ﬁnancial, medical, or any other reason) will have the full amount of their tuition remission and/or in-state tuition award rescinded and are then personally responsible for paying the full costs of tuition for that semester. Tuition remission and/or in-state tuition awards are not prorated. Appeals to the above policy must be directed to the Graduate School, along with a written recommendation from the Dean, Department Head, or Graduate Program Director for the student’s academic program, and a letter of conﬁrmation from Student Health Services if the resignation is for medical reasons.  UNC Greensboro 2023-24 University Catalog 825 For international students who are required to have an assistantship to maintain immigration status or students required to maintain an assistantship for other reasons, loss of an assistantship may change the ability to continue studies at UNCG. Loss of an assistantship may also change eligibility for certain forms of ﬁnancial aid. It is the student’s responsibility to understand these implications and work with appropriate ofﬁces where necessary. Termination by Student Graduate students who decide to terminate their assistantship appointments should consult with the assistantship supervisors as soon as possible — and if possible, at least two weeks prior to termination — to ensure a smooth transition in hiring a replacement graduate assistant. The notice of termination, prepared by the student, should be both verbal and written. Withdrawing from the University (that is, withdrawing from all classes) will result in the termination of an assistantship. International students should consult with appropriate ofﬁces relating to immigration/ visa status if considering this option. Termination for Academic Deﬁciency An assistantship may be terminated for academic deﬁciency if a student drops below the minimum credit hour requirement or  fails to meet other academic requirements as described under Academic Good Standing under Eligibility to Remain in Graduate School in Section I. Any student placed on probation will be terminated from their assistantship by the Graduate School. Students may lose their assistantship without being dismissed from the University. Termination for Failure to Perform Duties If, in the opinion of the immediate supervisor of the graduate assistant, a student is not carrying out the duties of their assistantship satisfactorily, the supervisor will immediately provide feedback to the student and attempt to resolve the problem. All conversations and feedback will be documented and placed in the student’s written record with a copy provided to the student. If the student’s performance remains unsatisfactory, the student will receive a written warning from the department chair (or designee) delivered through ofﬁcial UNCG email detailing the nature of the problem. If, after this formal warning, the student fails to improve to reasonable standards, the department chair will give the student a written notice of termination of assistantship. This letter of termination will be sent to the student through ofﬁcial UNCG email and will specify the date of termination and any requirements for vacating the position. At least two weeks should elapse between the written warning and the notice of termination. The Dean of the Graduate School will be notiﬁed of the termination. Termination for Cause An assistantship may be terminated without notice for serious violations of UNCG’s community norms and values, including violations of the Academic Integrity Policy. Allegations regarding violations of this nature should be referred to the appropriate disciplinary body. If a student is unable to perform their duties resulting from violations such as these, their assistantship shall be suspended pending completion of due process. A student suspended from their assistantship but found not to not be guilty of the alleged violations shall be reinstated in good standing and reimbursed for lost assistantship revenue. Termination Due to Loss of External Funding or Financial Exigency A sudden or unexpected loss of funding from either an external funding source or (in very rare cases) a dramatic change to the University budget environment may result in the termination of an assistantship. While the University works diligently to reduce the probability of this outcome, it is possible that unexpected developments could require this step. Unexpected loss of external funding cannot be used to justify termination of assistantships not directly funded by that project. Should the University receive notiﬁcation that research funding will be discontinued, the affected graduate students will be notiﬁed with as much advance notice as possible. Departments shall make every effort to secure funding to enable affected students to continue throughout the current semester. Adding a Course Students who have received a tuition remission and/or in-state tuition award that is less than nine (9) credit hours and registers for more than the amount awarded may contact their Graduate Program Director to see if funds are available to cover the additional costs. If funds are not available, the student will be billed and is responsible for paying for the additional credits. Dropping a Course Students who have received a fellowship, tuition remission, and/or in- state tuition award who drop a course at any point in the semester will be re-evaluated to ensure that they still meet the eligibility requirements to receive ﬁnancial support. Students who meet the eligibility requirements and for whom the reduction in credit hours occurs before the census date (generally two weeks after classes begin) may have their ﬁnancial account adjusted with no penalty.  Please consult the Graduate School about the consequences of dropping a course after the census date. Withdrawal Withdrawal from the University constitutes an immediate termination of support. (See Termination by Student above.) Hourly on-campus Employment Nonacademic employment opportunities are available on-campus on a ﬁrst-come, ﬁrst-considered basis. Once all appropriate requirements are met, applications may be made directly to the hiring source. Protections Graduate students at UNCG are future colleagues and should be treated with respect beﬁtting that status. Students are entitled to a workplace free from harassment and/or discrimination. If students feel they have been subject to a hostile work environment, harassment, discrimination, abuse, or have any other concern about working and academic conditions, they should contact the Ofﬁce of Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (https://diversity-inclusion.uncg.edu/),  Ofﬁce of Human Resources (https://hrs.uncg.edu/), or the Dean of the Graduate School. It is considered misconduct for individuals to enter into a romantic or sexual relationship with any student for whom they currently serve in an evaluative, directing or supervisory role, or in circumstances where the student is part of a group of students whom they oversee, regardless of whether the relationship is consensual.  826 Graduate Policies UNCG Policy on Discrimination and Harassment UNCG is committed to equal opportunity in education and employment for all persons and will not tolerate any discrimination against or harassment of persons on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, political afﬁliation, genetic information, veteran status, disabling condition, or age. Section III: Summary of Graduate School Regulations for All Certiﬁcates and Degrees Graduate Certiﬁcates A graduate certiﬁcate provides a credential to document the acquisition of skills and knowledge in a narrowly focused subset of a broader ﬁeld. Certiﬁcates may provide a credential in the focus area with as few as nine (9) and as many as twenty-seven (27) credit hours.  Certiﬁcates may be pursued independently, or degree-seeking students may choose to embed a certiﬁcate within their plan of study. Students may be interested in gaining both a graduate degree and a certiﬁcate credential. Students must be admitted to both programs. A matriculated, degree-seeking student who is concurrently pursuing a certiﬁcate may apply academic credit to both the certiﬁcate and degree programs. The certiﬁcate functions as an area of specialization, like a minor. Enrolled students do not have to pay the application fee to pursue a concurrent certiﬁcate. All students must apply to and be accepted by Certiﬁcate Programs. Students who have graduated and then later discover they have fulﬁlled requirements for a certiﬁcate may neither apply for that certiﬁcate, nor be awarded it. Graduate certiﬁcates do not automatically qualify for federal ﬁnancial aid unless the certiﬁcate has been approved through the gainful employment requirements. Summary of Requirements for Certiﬁcates • Full admission to a certiﬁcate program. • A plan of study submitted to the Graduate School when applying for graduation. • Satisfactory completion of all course requirements. • A minimum GPA of 3.0 in all certiﬁcate courses and a minimum overall GPA of 3.0. • Payment of the graduation fee. Semester Hours Required for Certiﬁcates In general, certiﬁcate programs range between twelve (12) to eighteen (18) semester hours of graduate courses with at least half of this course work at the 600-level or above. No certiﬁcate may require fewer than nine (9) hours. A certiﬁcate program may petition for a 9-credit program if that number of credits is associated with external demands. No more than three (3) semester hours with a grade of C+ (2.3) or C (2.0) will count towards a certiﬁcate. All courses for a certiﬁcate will be letter graded except for internships, practicums, independent projects, or clinical work. Plan of Study for Certiﬁcates The course work comprising the certiﬁcate program must be an integrated and organized sequence of study. Independent Study for Certiﬁcates Independent Study is not permitted for certiﬁcate students. Transfer Credit for Certiﬁcates Subject to time limits, a maximum of three (3) semester hours of transfer credit will be accepted toward a certiﬁcate upon recommendation of the department. (See Transfer Credit under Course Credit in Section I for more information.) Master’s Degrees Summary of Requirements for Master’s Degrees • Full admission to a master’s degree program. • Submission of plan of study to the Graduate School prior to 50% of program completion. • Satisfactory completion of all course requirements. • Achievement of the required B (3.0) GPA overall: for courses listed on the plan of study, and, if required by the department, for the major. • Minimum requirements for the degree: no more than six (6) semester credit hours evaluated as C+ (2.3) and/or C (2.0). • Completion of all milestone requirements: as required by degree program (foreign language, comprehensive exams, etc.). • Capstone Experience:  at the discretion of individual programs, may include some combination of (a) comprehensive written or oral examination, (b) thesis or research paper, (c) portfolio, (d) creative work, and/or (e) internship experience. • An application for graduation and the ﬁnal Plan of Study: ﬁled with the Graduate School by the end of the ﬁrst week of classes of the term in which the degree will be granted. • Payment of the graduation fee. • Payment of all accounts owed the University:  diplomas and transcripts of students owing money to the University withheld until the account is cleared. All the requirements above must be met by the deadlines stated in the Academic Calendar. Some special programs may have additional requirements not listed above but explained in materials supplied by the major department or school. Requirements for Master's Degrees Plans of Study for Master’s Degrees The Plan of Study sets the speciﬁc requirements for the degree as determined by the advisory committee, consistent with the speciﬁc program guidelines and Graduate School policy. These credits constitute the core of each student’s graduate degree curriculum. The Plan of Study must be signed by the student and Graduate Program Director/designee at the earliest practical time following the student’s admission to the Graduate School, but no later than 50% of the program’s completion. The plan must indicate the following: • All courses the student is expected to complete as a minimum requirement, including courses required for the major, supporting courses, number of elective hours, and courses recommended for transfer.  UNC Greensboro 2023-24 University Catalog 827 • Courses required by the department but not counted toward the degree, including prerequisite courses. • No more than six (6) semester hours of independent study. • No more than six (6) semester hours of credit evaluated as C+ (2.3) and/or C (2.0) applied toward the minimum hours required for the degree. • At least one half of the course work credited toward the degree must be in 600-level courses or above. • Capstone Experience. Credit earned for STA 667 Statistical Consulting is not applicable to a graduate plan of study. Undergraduate courses or courses not required on the POS are not eligible for ﬁnancial aid or state funding. Language Requirements The following degree programs require demonstration of foreign language proﬁciency: History M.A., English M.A., Music M.M. (voice and conducting), and French/Spanish M.A., M.Ed. and M.A.T. Speciﬁc requirements are stated under the respective departmental program description in the University Catalog and further deﬁned in department handbooks. Exceptions to any language requirement are made at the discretion of the major department. Capstone Requirement A capstone experience is a complex assignment that involves many steps and serves as a culminating academic and intellectual experience at the end of an academic program. Typically, capstones provide evidence of synthesis and evaluation. The capstone experience may comprise a comprehensive written or oral examination, thesis or research paper, portfolio, creative work, internship, or some combination of these courses. Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval is required for research involving human subjects. In addition, both the supervising faculty member and the student researcher must have a current CITI certiﬁcate on ﬁle with the Ofﬁce of Research and Engagement. For students whose research involves animals, Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) approval is required. Required approval must be obtained prior to initiating any such research with these populations. Capstones should be completed in the ﬁnal stages of the master’s degree. If a failing grade is given on the ﬁrst attempt to satisfy the capstone requirement, the student may be allowed one additional attempt, with permission of the Graduate Program Director. If the student fails to meet the department’s minimum criteria for the capstone experience on the second attempt, the GPD shall notify the Graduate School will subsequently send the student a letter of dismissal from the program. Maximum credit allowed for Capstones is six (6) hours. Additional extension hours may be required to maintain continuous enrollment but do not count toward the degree, do not qualify the student for graduate school support, and are ineligible for ﬁnancial aid. Speciﬁc Requirements for Thesis Students Students propose and prepare a thesis under the guidance of a thesis committee comprising a chair and at least one other member appointed by the Graduate Program Director. The chair must be a full member of the Graduate Faculty; other committee members may be adjunct members. Although all members of the committee may come from the major department, appointment of one member from another department is allowed. An oral examination on the thesis may be required at the discretion of the major department or school, either for the individual or all students in a thesis program. The process for submitting the approved thesis to the Graduate School has two components: 1) Submitting the approval copy and 2) Submitting the ﬁnal copy. Speciﬁc instructions afﬁliated with each step are available on the Graduate School's website (http://grs.uncg.edu/enrolled/ etd/); deadline dates are available in the Academic Calendar (https:// reg.uncg.edu/calendars/). Students submit their thesis via the online submission system available on the Graduate School’s website (http://grs.uncg.edu/enrolled/ etd/). The submission must conform to UNC Greensboro’s formatting requirements and must be uploaded by the deadline dates as speciﬁed in the Academic Calendar. The Graduate School requires all approved theses to be published through UMI Dissertation Publishing/ProQuest Information and Learning. There is no charge for basic publishing; however, optional services requested by the candidate during submission may have associated charges. Examinations If the capstone for a master’s program is a written or oral exam, the student register during the semester(s) in which exams are graded. The Graduate School permits examinations to be rescheduled or held via distance technologies in cases of extreme hardship. The department head will ensure that all participants agree with the chosen format. Transfer Credit and Cross-registration for Master’s Degrees (See Transfer Credit under Course Credit in Section I for more information.) At the master’s level, credit may be given for graduate work taken at other institutions, but certain conditions must be met: • It must be approved both by the student’s major department and by the Dean of the Graduate School. • It must be necessary to meet speciﬁc degree requirements. • Transfer credit may not exceed one-third of the minimum number of hours required by the student’s program not including thesis or capstone hours. • Cross-registration at other UNC institutions, in combination with transfer credit, may not exceed 50% of the total hours required by the student’s program. • All credit offered in transfer must have been taken at an accredited graduate school and not have been used to complete the requirements for a previously-earned degree. • Such work must have been taken within the ﬁve-year time limit. • The student must have earned a grade of B (3.0) or better on all transfer credit. In a four-letter grading system, only credit earned with either of the top two grades is transferable. The transfer of credit where a grade of P or its equivalent is received in a two- or three-letter grading system (such as P-F, S-U, or H-P-F) reduces hour for hour the number of C grades earned that may count toward the minimum requirement for the degree. • The credit must be recorded on an ofﬁcial transcript placed on ﬁle with the Graduate School.  828 Graduate Policies Hours only, not grades, may be transferred from other institutions. When grades are provided for cross-registered courses, the grade will factor into the GPA. Quarter-hours do not transfer as semester hours. A fraction of an hour of credit will not be transferred. See sample below: 2         quarter hours transfer as 1 semester hour. 3-4     quarter hours transfer as 2 semester hours. 5         quarter hours transfer as 3 semester hours. 6-7     quarter hours transfer as 4 semester hours. 8         quarter hours transfer as 5 semester hours. 9-10   quarter hours transfer as 6 semester hours. Students must secure approval from their major advisor and the Dean of the Graduate School in advance of registration at other universities. In general, however, not less than two-thirds of the total program for the master’s degree must be completed at The University of North Carolina at Greensboro. All credit to be transferred must come within the time limit described above and must be supported by ﬁling an ofﬁcial copy of the transcript with the Graduate School. No credit will be transferred unless it is required to meet speciﬁc degree requirements. No more than three (3) semester hours of institute and workshop credit may be counted toward satisfying the minimum requirements for the master’s degrees. Master of Fine Arts Degrees M.F.A. programs are specialized graduate programs that focus on the actual practice of a creative skill. This concentrated professional degree is intended to provide the student with an advanced education prior to becoming a practicing professional. MFA students produce creative work throughout the program; capstone projects are expected to demonstrate a high level of professional competence and maturity. M.F.A. degrees are typically sixty (60) credit hours. Admission is based on a combination of undergraduate academic history, professional experience, and demonstrated creative skill. UNCG offers M.F.A. degrees in Creative Writing; Dance with a concentration in choreography; Drama with concentrations in Acting, Directing, Design: and Theatre for Youth; Interior Architecture; and Studio Arts. M.F.A. Requirements Plan of Study M.F.A. Degrees The Plan of Study will determine speciﬁc requirements for the degree as determined by the advisory committee, consistent with the speciﬁc program guidelines and Graduate School policy. These credits constitute the core of an M.F.A. graduate degree curriculum. The Plan of Study must be signed by the student and Graduate Program Director at the earliest practical time following the student’s admission to the Graduate School, but no later than the registration period during the second semester of enrollment. The plan must indicate the following: • All courses the student is expected to complete as a minimum requirement, including courses required for the major, supporting courses, number of elective hours, and courses recommended for transfer. • Courses required by the department but not counted toward the degree, including prerequisite courses. • No more than six (6) semester hours of independent study. • No more than six (6) semester hours of credit evaluated as C+ (2.3) and/or C (2.0) applied toward the minimum hours required for the degree. • At least one half of the course work credited toward the degree must be in 600-level courses or above. • Capstone Experience. Capstone Requirement for MFA Each candidate for the M.F.A. should be required to present a ﬁnal body of work or culminating performance demonstrating professional competence in the ﬁeld. A written document or thesis that demonstrates a student’s ability to think critically and contextualize their work historically and/or theoretically and within the landscape of contemporary practices is a requirement of some programs, but the focus of the capstone experience should be creative or visual work. Unless otherwise speciﬁed, M.F.A. students are subject to the academic policies associated with master’s degrees. Doctoral Degrees A doctoral degree is the highest degree a student can earn for graduate study. Course work leading to the doctoral degree is planned to give students a comprehensive knowledge of their ﬁeld of specialization and a proﬁciency in the methods of research. The ﬁnal basis for granting the degree is their grasp of the subject matter across a broad ﬁeld of study, their competence in planning and conducting research, and the ability to express themselves adequately and professionally both orally and in writing. Only the dissertation committee can certify that they have earned this degree. UNCG offers two classiﬁcations of doctoral degrees. The Ph.D. is classiﬁed as doctoral degree of research and scholarship. The D.N.P., D.M.A., and Ed.D. are classiﬁed as a doctoral degree of professional practice. Many doctoral programs require students to have previously earned a master’s degree. Some doctoral programs allow students with a bachelor’s degree to matriculate directly into the doctoral degree program; others are admitted through a doctoral track program. Master's Doctoral Track Permission to Proceed A student admitted to the Graduate School into one of the doctoral track programs is required to earn a master’s degree. Upon completion of 30 credit hours, the Graduate Program Director must evaluate each doctoral- track student and submit the Recommendation to Proceed Beyond Master’s Degree Form to the Graduate School for each student who is considered qualiﬁed and recommended for doctoral study. Students who are recommended to continue in the doctoral program are not required to ﬁle a separate application with the Graduate School. Students recommended to continue are subject to the same examination policies of all doctoral students. Students are coded into Banner as master’s students until the master’s degree is awarded. At that time, students who have been recommended to continue will be moved to doctoral pre- candidate status in Banner. Doctoral Degrees of Research and Scholarship These are doctoral degrees that require advanced work beyond the master's level, including the preparation and defense of a dissertation  UNC Greensboro 2023-24 University Catalog 829 based on original research, or the planning and execution of an original project demonstrating substantial artistic or scholarly achievement. Doctor of Philosphy (Ph.D.) The degree of Doctor of Philosophy is conferred upon those students who have completed, with high distinction, a prescribed period of intensive study and investigation culminating in an original dissertation offering a signiﬁcant new contribution to knowledge in their subject. A Ph.D. may be earned in Business Administration, Chemistry and Biochemistry, Communication Sciences and Disorders; Community Health Education; Computational Mathematics; Computer Science; Consumer, Apparel, and Retail Studies; Counseling and Counselor Education; Economics; Educational Research, Measurement and Evaluation; Educational Studies; English; Environmental Health Science; Geography; History; Human Development and Family Studies; Information Systems; Kinesiology; Music Education; Nanoscience; Nursing; Nutrition; Psychology; Social Work, and Special Education. Doctor of Musical Arts (D.M.A.) The Doctor of Musical Arts degree program is a performance-oriented degree offered only in the School of Music. The requirements of the Graduate School apply to the Doctor of Musical Arts; however, due to the highly specialized nature of the degree, the student should consult the Graduate Program Director in the School of Music and the D.M.A. Graduate Handbook (https://vpa.uncg.edu/wp-content/ uploads/2019/09/DMA-Handbook-8-2019.docx) for speciﬁc requirements and procedures. Doctor of Education (Ed.D.) The major premise of the Doctor of Education degree program is that students receive depth in subject matter as well as professional development. Therefore, the program is purposely flexible, allowing the students to develop, with their advisory committee, a course of study best suited to their ability, experience, and major professional goal. It is expected that each student will make a signiﬁcant research contribution to the discipline culminating in a scholarly dissertation. An Ed.D. may be earned in Educational Leadership or in Kinesiology. Doctoral Degrees of Professional Practice These are doctoral degrees that are conferred upon completion of a program providing the knowledge and skills for the recognition, credential, or license required for professional practice or teaching. Dissertations for these doctoral degrees require the planning and execution of an original project demonstrating substantial artistic or scholarly achievement following disciplinary norms.  They often focus on applying existing knowledge and theories in original ways. The dissertation for the D.M.A. comprises live performance with written scholarship. Doctor of Nursing Practice (D.N.P.) The Doctor of Nursing Practice degree program is an applied degree offered only in the School of Nursing. The requirements of the Graduate School stated below apply to the Doctor of Nursing Practice; however, due to the highly specialized nature of the degree, students should consult the University Catalog for information regarding the speciﬁc requirements and procedures for the Doctor of Nursing Practice (p. 759). Minor Certain doctoral programs may permit, encourage, or require a minor, which is a formalized curricular sequence of advanced work in one or more areas outside the major ﬁeld but cognate to it. Students should ask the chair of their advisory/dissertation committee if a minor is appropriate or required. The minor must consist of at least 12 hours of study. The student’s advisory/dissertation committee approves the minor, and it must appear on the doctoral plan of study. For information concerning the doctoral minor in educational research and methodology, human development and family studies, information systems, and statistics, see the relevant academic programs. Concurrent (embedded) Certiﬁcates Students may pursue a graduate certiﬁcate concurrently with their doctoral program. Courses taken as part of a certiﬁcate program may also satisfy degree requirements. Certiﬁcates function similarly to a cognate, which is a minimum of nine (9) hours of course work organized around a narrow subﬁeld. Certiﬁcates provide doctoral students with the ability to earn enhanced credentials. Enrolled students do not have to pay the application fee to pursue a concurrent certiﬁcate. Summary of Requirements for all Doctoral Degrees • Admission to a doctoral program, including the removal of any deﬁciencies identiﬁed at the time of admission. • An initial academic advisor: assigned upon receipt of the intent to enroll form. • An approved advisory committee: ﬁled in the Graduate School by the end of eighteen (18) semester hours. • An approved plan of study: signed by the GPD and all other committee members and ﬁled in the Graduate School by the end of eighteen (18) semester hours. • Completion of all milestone requirements (e.g. language, research, exams). • Completion of the immersion requirement. • Completion of any required diagnostic qualifying examination. • Completion of all course requirements in the student’s approved program of study. • Completion of the comprehensive written and oral examination and any required additional work resulting from this examination. • Formation of an approved dissertation/project committee with an assigned chair/document mentor: ﬁled in the Graduate School before a student may defend the proposal. • Acceptance of a dissertation/project proposal: the approved topic ﬁled in the Graduate School. • Admission to candidacy upon the satisfaction of the requirements above (formal application to be made in the Graduate School). • Submission of a dissertation/document acceptable to the dissertation/project committee. • Satisfactory public oral defense of the dissertation. • Acceptance of the dissertation by the Graduate School. (Submission requirements differ for each type of doctorate; students should consult their Graduate Program Director.) • Application for graduation with the Graduate School: ﬁled by the end of the ﬁrst week of classes of the term in which the degree will be granted. • Payment of the graduation fee. • Payment of all accounts owed in the University: diplomas and transcripts of students owing money to the University withheld until the account is cleared. The requirements above are the minimal requirements of every doctoral program at UNCG and must be met by the deadlines stated in the Academic Calendar. Detailed explanations of these minimum  830 Graduate Policies requirements follow. Some programs may have additional requirements not listed above but are explained in detail in the speciﬁc doctoral program handbook. Students are expected to familiarize themselves with all program requirements. Admission to Doctoral Programs Admission to a doctoral program may occur in one of three ways: • Some programs may permit admission to a doctoral-track program directly from an undergraduate program in the case of exceptionally well-qualiﬁed applicants. The department will notify students if they are to move seamlessly into doctoral-level course work. The Graduate Program Director must ﬁle the Permission to Proceed to Pre-Candidacy Status. The decision to continue (or not) must be made no later than the completion of thirty (30) credit hours. Students in doctoral-track programs who are not allowed to continue may be awarded a master’s degree if the student has completed all requirements of the stand-alone master’s degree. • A student who has been awarded a master’s degree from UNCG, but is not in a doctoral-track program, must ﬁle an application and be admitted to a doctoral program. • A student who has been awarded a master’s degree from another institution must apply and be admitted to a doctoral program. The program will either administer a set of diagnostic exams, or carefully examine syllabi to determine which courses from the master’s degree may apply to the doctoral plan of study. In addition to satisfactory entrance examination scores and recommendations (explained in the application materials), ﬁnal approval of the major department or school and of the Dean of the Graduate School are required. Admission to doctoral programs is highly competitive. At times, academically qualiﬁed applicants may be denied due to program capacity constraints. Admitted students are placed in Pre-Candidate Status. Pre-Candidates acquire knowledge and tools needed to undertake original and independent research. They are exposed to the breadth of content in their discipline and learn the associated research theories and methods to focus intensively on a narrow and original area of research. A student achieves candidacy [all but dissertation (ABD)] upon completion of all pre-candidacy milestones. Academic Advisor(s) and Committees The Graduate Program Director is assigned as the initial Academic Advisor and is expected to guide the student in the selection of course work until the academic advisory committee is formed. Academic Advisory Committee and Chair The Academic Advisory Committee must be appointed, and the appointment form submitted, no later than the close of the registration window for the second semester of study (prior to the completion of eighteen (18) hours. The Academic Advisory Committee is appointed by the Dean of the Graduate School upon the recommendation of the major department head and must be mutually acceptable to the student and all committee members. This committee may be comprised of only one member of the Graduate Faculty. Any other members of the department who are also members of the Graduate Faculty may serve on an Academic Advisory Committee. The Academic Advisory Committee may mentor the student in all aspects of the program until the Dissertation Committee is formed and approved. Doctoral Committees The minimum number of faculty required for all doctoral committees is three, with the majority from the program. The chair must be from the department and a member of the graduate faculty; adjunct members may serve but may not chair. Individual programs handle committee assignments in the manner that best suits progress to degree completion for that discipline. It is not unusual for a student to have an academic advisory committee who guides the student in the pre-candidacy phase and a ﬁnal dissertation committee with the expertise to guide and mentor the speciﬁc topic of dissertation research. Faculty serving on committees are expected to approve the Plan of Study; evaluate any diagnostic or qualifying exams; rule on special programmatic decisions and policy applications; prepare, approve, and evaluate the comprehensive (written and oral) examination; guide the dissertation; and, serve as the examining board for the oral defense. Depending on department culture, these responsibilities may be extended beyond the student’s committee. However, only the approved Dissertation Committee has the authority to determine if the proposal has been accepted and the dissertation defense has passed. Dissertation Committee and Chair The Dissertation Committee, comprising at least three graduate faculty (with a suggested maximum of ﬁve), should be ﬁnalized prior to the defense of the dissertation proposal. The Chair serves as the primary mentor and in consultation with the committee, guides the student in the preparation of the dissertation proposal, the dissertation itself, and conducts the ﬁnal oral examination (dissertation defense). Only the Dissertation Committee may accept the dissertation proposal and determine the results of the dissertation defense. Programs will determine whether a member outside of the discipline is required or not. The Dean of the Graduate School appoints this committee upon the recommendation of the major Department Head or Graduate Program Director and must be mutually acceptable to the student and all committee members. Of the three members, the chair must be from the program department, and at least two must be Members of the Graduate Faculty. An appointment as a Courtesy Member of the Graduate Faculty must be made for any member from outside the University. Individual doctoral programs may have additional dissertation committee requirements. Students should consult the program handbook for speciﬁc details. The Graduate Program Director coordinates committee appointments and adjustments and is ultimately responsible for ensuring compliance with Graduate School policies. (See Policy on Appointment to the Graduate Faculty (https://drive.google.com/ﬁle/d/13orBJE9NBnO- YcGtzVbYHoSqZYsPky3o/view/) for further details). Students and Faculty may wish to consult the document Best Practices in Advising and Mentoring Graduate Students (https://grs.uncg.edu/wp- content/uploads/2019/09/Best-Practices-in-Graduate-Mentoring.pdf). This document contains the formal policies and procedures that govern these relationships and conveys general expectations for both faculty and students. Doctoral Requirements Research Competence Research and innovation are central to doctoral education. Therefore, competence in research is required of all doctoral students. Whereas the speciﬁc requirements will vary from ﬁeld to ﬁeld and according to  UNC Greensboro 2023-24 University Catalog 831 the student’s professional objective, the plan of study must provide for proﬁciency in techniques of research that not only are appropriate to the ﬁeld of study but also will help prepare prospective holders of the doctorate to continue their intellectual and professional growth. Language Requirement for the Ph.D. in English, History and the D.M.A. in Music Doctoral students in English, History, and Music (voice and conducting) each have foreign language requirements. Students should consult their program handbook for detailed information on how to satisfy this requirement. The language requirements must be passed prior to the comprehensive examinations and prior to admission to candidacy. The language or languages used to satisfy a language requirement must be approved by the student’s major advisor. French, German, and Spanish are most frequently used. A student whose native tongue is a language other than English may use English, but not the native language, to satisfy a language requirement. When English is offered, the Department of English or the student’s major department in consultation with the Department of English will administer the examination. A statement certifying the candidate’s proﬁciency in English must be ﬁled in the Graduate School before the comprehensive examination may be taken. Doctoral Students and Immersion Within a Community of Scholars The Graduate School expects all graduate programs to encourage and provide opportunities for immersion of doctoral students in scholarship. Immersion goals can be achieved by multiple means, including, but not limited to, individual and group research training; providing access to resources such as libraries, research equipment, scholarly materials, and laboratories; providing networking opportunities with UNCG and external scholars and graduate students; participation in scholarly seminars presented by scholars from UNCG or elsewhere; assisting with developing applications for external funding of scholarly endeavors; participation at scholarly conferences; and publications or other forms of scholarly dissemination. Doctoral students are expected to satisfy an immersion requirement, which provides them the opportunity for an extended period of intensive study and intellectual and professional development among a community of scholars. Immersion “allows students to concentrate focused time on their degree, acquire the necessary habits, attitudes, skills, and insights” (CGS, 2005) required for contributions to scholarship and have opportunities to work closely with other scholars, including faculty and other graduate students. These scholarly skills, attitudes, and experiences go beyond acquiring knowledge in classes and in experience in professional practice. The Immersion Requirement for doctoral degree programs (Ph.D., Ed.D., D.M.A., D.N.P.) can be accomplished through one of two mechanisms: 1. Two consecutive semesters of six-credit-hour enrollment on campus. Programs will be expected to provide opportunities during those two semesters to cultivate immersion in scholarship and achieve the goals of residency. Students completing residency via full- time enrollment should understand residency goals and plan not only to complete required courses, but also to sustain scholarly engagement and immersion in research, scholarship and professional development. 2. Program-speciﬁc alternative immersion plan. Academic degree programs may propose alternative methods by which enrolled students in the program will achieve immersion goals to be approved by the Graduate School. The approved plans will be documented in the Catalog as well as on the program’s Plan of Study template. Program-speciﬁc alternatives may be proposed for doctoral degree programs offered online or for site-based programs. Courses taken by UNCG degree students via inter-institutional registration earn immersion credit as if they were courses on UNCG’s campus. Credit Requirements for Doctoral Degrees The minimum credits required for direct-entry doctoral programs are forty-ﬁve (45) hours inclusive of dissertation hours. Doctoral programs that award a master’s degree as part of the doctoral program must comprise a minimum of sixty (60) total hours, with thirty (30) earned post-master’s. Students entering a program with an earned master’s in a related ﬁeld must complete at least thirty (30) course hours before enrolling in dissertation hours and an additional twelve (12) credits minimum must be dissertation hours. A minimum of eighteen (18) credit hours of didactic course work and a minimum of twelve (12) hours of dissertation research are required for any doctoral degree. Transfer Credit for Doctoral Degrees In some instances, work done in other institutions may be counted toward the degree, particularly work culminating in a master’s degree from an institution accredited by the Accrediting Commission for Community and Junior Colleges (ACCJC) Western Association of Schools and Colleges, the Higher Learning Commission (HLC), the Middle States Commission on Higher Education (MSCHE), the New England Commission of Higher Education (NECHE), the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities (NWCCU), the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC), or the WASC Senior College and University Commission (WSCUC) and representing an appropriate area of study. If the student proposes the transfer of credit from another graduate school, the work for which credit was received must be covered by the comprehensive examination, and the transfer must be recommended by the student’s advisory/dissertation committee before the Graduate School will credit the work to the student’s doctoral program. A maximum of one-third of non-dissertation course credit hours may be transferred to a doctoral program. The following conditions apply to transfer credit for doctoral program: • All credit offered in transfer must have been taken at an accredited graduate school. • Such work must have been taken within the time limit described above. • The student must have earned a grade of B (3.0) or better on all transfer credit. In a four-letter grading system, only credit earned with either of the top two grades is transferable. • The credit must be recorded on an ofﬁcial transcript placed on ﬁle with the Graduate School. • The credit must be approved by both the student’s doctoral advisory/ dissertation committee and the Dean of the Graduate School. • The credit must be necessary to meet speciﬁc degree requirements.  832 Graduate Policies Hours only, not grades, may be transferred from other institutions. Quarter-hours do not transfer as semester hours. A fraction of an hour of credit will not be transferred. See sample below: 2           quarter hours transfer as 1 semester hour. 3-4       quarter hours transfer as 2 semester hours. 5           quarter hours transfer as 3 semester hours. 6-7       quarter hours transfer as 4 semester hours. 8           quarter hours transfer as 5 semester hours. 9-10      quarter hours transfer as 6 semester hours. Students must secure approval from their doctoral committee and the Dean of the Graduate School in advance of registration at other universities. To ensure that the courses fall within the time limit permitted, the transfer credit will be accepted ﬁnally and posted to the transcript only at the time of completion of the degree requirements. (See Transfer Credit under Course Credit in Section I for more information.) Milestones for Doctoral Programs Doctoral education comprises a set number of credit hours earned through graded courses as listed in the course requirements above, an original dissertation, and a series of scholarly requirements and exams that are referred to as milestones. To support the philosophy and practice of the Graduate School to respect disciplinary norms and expertise, the Graduate School does not concern itself with the process by which milestones are accomplished. Your program is expected to adhere to the overarching purpose of each milestone. Information on how these milestones are accomplished must be clearly documented in each Doctoral Program Handbook, which is the authoritative source for the procedures for satisfying milestones. All students shall be subject to these processes. Failure to do so may be grounds for a student grievance. Diagnostic Exams (optional) The Graduate School does not require programs to administer diagnostic examinations. However, some programs require that new students take a diagnostic exam given and evaluated before the close of the drop/add period. Diagnostic exams serve to identify deﬁciencies requiring pre- requisite course work, acceptability of any transfer credit, and/or inform the Plan of Study. Plan of Study and Permission to Continue in a Doctoral Program A Plan of Study for the doctoral degree must be ﬁled with the Graduate School no later than the close of the registration window for the third semester of study for approval by the Dean of the Graduate School. This is generally before the completion of eighteen (18) credit hours. The Plan of Study requires the signature of the Graduate Program Director and all other members of the academic or dissertation advisory committee. The Dean of the Graduate School reserves the right to refer any or all plans of study to the Graduate Council for review and recommendation. Filing the plan of study by the end of the ﬁrst year signiﬁes permission to continue in the Graduate School. Students who fail to ﬁle the Plan of Study upon completion of eighteen (18) hours will have a registration hold placed on their account. This hold will remain until an approved Plan of Study is ﬁled with the Graduate School. Copies of the approved Plan of Study must be ﬁled in the student’s permanent academic record in the Graduate School, in the department’s ﬁles, with the chair and each member of the advisory/dissertation committee, and with the student. Any subsequent changes in the Plan of Study must be submitted to the Graduate School for approval. The Plan of Study must indicate the following: • Major and minor ﬁelds of study. • All prerequisite or leveling course work. • Speciﬁc courses the student is expected to complete as a minimum requirement with at least eighteen (18) hours of didactic course work and a minimum of twelve (12) hours of dissertation. (If the topic for a Seminar or Topics Course is not yet determined, the GPD may indicate just the Course Number or other such placeholder.) • All speciﬁc course requirements, language, and research requirements of the major department. • No more than one quarter of the course work credited to the degree, exclusive of the dissertation, at the 500 level. • No more than 15 semester hours of independent study. (See additional requirements above to pursue Independent Study.) The following constraints apply: • No credit evaluated lower than a B (3.0) may be applied toward satisfying a degree requirement. • Additional hours must be taken for any hours earned with a grade of B- (2.7) or less. • Credit earned for STA 667 Statistical Consulting is not applicable to a graduate plan of study. Qualifying Examination (optional) The Graduate School does not require programs to administer qualifying examinations, which are typically taken at the end of the ﬁrst year. In such cases, qualifying examinations are intended to provide an early, general assessment of a student’s proﬁciency in content and/or conceptual understanding of the research process. They may also serve to inform the Plan of Study. If a student is recommended for withdrawal, the Graduate School must be notiﬁed. Milestones Examinations Required for All Doctoral Programs A committee of at least three members of the graduate faculty must participate in the preparation and holding of all milestone examinations. Although other members of the program may provide input, it is the sole decision of the established committee to determine the result of a milestone exam. A unanimous decision is required to pass. A student who fails any milestone examination is terminated from graduate work at UNCG unless the committee unanimously requests a re-examination. Only a single re-examination will be allowed; it can encompass written, oral, or both components as determined by the advisory committee. If the GPD or the Graduate School denies the request, the student’s program is terminated, and the Graduate School will send the student a letter of dismissal from the program. In all cases, a student will be dismissed from the Graduate School if any required or option milestone exam is failed a second time. The Graduate School must be notiﬁed in a timely manner upon completion of all milestones.  UNC Greensboro 2023-24 University Catalog 833 Comprehensive Examination The written and the oral comprehensive examinations together constitute a comprehensive examination of the student's command of the ﬁeld. This is the exam of breadth. The deﬁnition of “comprehensive” varies by academic program, but here means an examination whose thoroughness in all ways conforms to the best accepted practices within the discipline. The form of the comprehensive examination in any degree program is described in that graduate program handbook and all students shall be subject to the written policy and procedures. The overarching purposes of the comprehensive exam are to: • evaluate the student’s overall proﬁciency in a body of knowledge and skills after most of the program of study is completed; • test the candidate's knowledge of all transferred courses; • discover any weaknesses in the candidate's knowledge that need to be remedied by additional courses or other instruction; and • determine the candidate's ﬁtness to continue work toward the doctorate. Each doctoral student is required to pass the doctoral comprehensive examination. A student may attempt the comprehensive examination only on the recommendation of the advisory committee and only after a student has satisfactorily completed all prerequisite course work, removed identiﬁed deﬁciencies, satisﬁed language requirements, and completed most of the course work contained in the program of study. Individual departments may have additional requirements. The exam should be taken one or two semesters before the semester of anticipated candidacy to allow the committee to make changes to the Plan of Study if necessary. The written part is scheduled and prepared based on what is indicated in the program handbook. The questions may cover any aspect of the course work taken by the student during the period of this graduate study or any subject logically related and basic to an understanding of the subject matter of the major and minor areas of study. Any transferred course work is subject to examination at the time of the comprehensive examination. The questions are designed to measure the student’s proﬁciency in their ﬁeld and the adequacy of preparation for research. The result of the written exam must be ﬁled with the Graduate School before the oral portion may be held. The written exam may result in one of three determinations: • Pass • Conditional (Put conditions in writing and be clear on a due date) • Fail Any requirement for re-writes of any portion (or all) of the exam constitutes a Conditional result. Conditional grades must be reported to the Graduate School indicating the conditions and due date. If the committee so determines, any identiﬁed weaknesses may be addressed during the oral portion of the exam, which constitutes a Pass. In the case of a Non-Pass, the student must petition the committee for permission to retake the exam. If granted, the student must wait until the following semester to ensure enough preparation time. The oral portion of the comprehensive examination should be scheduled within one month following the passing of the written examination. The purpose of the oral examination is to explore in greater depth questions on the written exam and to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the ﬁeld of specialization and related areas. Many programs also require students to present and/or defend the dissertation proposal as part of the oral comprehensive exam. In such cases, the dissertation committee must be formally appointed and in attendance for the oral portion of the comprehensive exam. The oral exam may result in one of three determinations: • Pass • Conditional (Put conditions in writing and be clear on a due date) • Fail Any requirement for re-examination constitutes a Conditional result. Conditional grades must be reported to the Graduate School indicating the conditions and due date. In the case of a Non-Pass, the student must petition the committee for permission to retake the oral exam. If granted, the student must wait until the following semester to ensure enough preparation time. Any student who fails either portion of the comprehensive examination twice or whose petition for a re-examination is denied will be dismissed from the program. Dissertation Proposal Approval (required) The Graduate School encourages and supports the wide range of dissertation topics and methodologies generated in the programs. The dissertation proposal represents a formal understanding between the Dissertation Committee and the doctoral student. The proposal approval along with the ﬁnal oral defense of the dissertation constitute the exam of depth. This agreement outlines the work to be done and the intellectual rigor the Committee expects from the student. The proposal functions as a map, guiding the student towards the effective completion of the dissertation project. The dissertation proposal should substantially advance the doctoral candidate toward completion of the dissertation.  In many cases, it takes the form of the comprehensive chapters of the dissertation. The proposal should contain detail enough to describe the signiﬁcance, background, and rationale for the dissertation and the work the Candidate will perform for the dissertation. Proposal approval is initiated often as part of the oral portion of the comprehensive exam. Some programs expect a proposal defense that is a scheduled and announced public event.  However, the deliberations of the Dissertation Committee shall be private. Program handbook must have clear processes as to how proposals are accepted. Multiple Authored Dissertations In situations where dissertations have multiple authors, it is the responsibility of the advisory/dissertation committee chair to identify the percentage of proposed work to be developed by each of the contributors and submit it to the Graduate School for approval. To be submitted as part of a student’s dissertation, the student must be primary author. This must be done at the proposal stage and again at the ﬁnal defense if the original plan has been revised. (See Dissertations with Multiple Authors form (https://grs.uncg.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Dissertations- with-Multiple-Authors.pdf).) Admission to Candidacy In general, students should advance to candidacy no later than three calendar years after the ﬁrst enrollment in a UNCG doctoral program, a doctoral track student may often take four years. A student who does not achieve candidacy within three years and is not making satisfactory progress may be recommended for academic probation or dismissal. Students must apply for candidacy by the deadline speciﬁed in the academic calendar during the semester they expect to complete all requirements for candidacy. The Graduate Program Director must submit  834 Graduate Policies the Admission to Candidacy form and a ﬁnal plan of study to move a student to candidacy status. This will certify that the requirements for candidacy will have been met by the end of a given semester. As soon as grades are ﬁled for that semester, the Graduate School will inform the GPD and the student if they have been moved to candidacy status. Normally, the enrollment status of a student who achieves candidacy will be changed for the start of the next semester. However, students who achieve candidacy after the start of a semester but prior to census, will have their status moved to candidacy. Candidacy allows students to retain Graduate School beneﬁts and eligibility for ﬁnancial aid by enrolling in three (3) credits of 799. No changes to a Plan of Study are permitted once a student is admitted to candidacy. Students admitted to candidacy are considered all but dissertation (ABD) and may only register for 799. The Dissertation The dissertation is the product of a thorough investigation of a basic and signiﬁcant problem or question within the major area of study. An appropriate plan of research must be developed and executed by the student under the general guidance of the chair and the dissertation committee. Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval is required for research involving human subjects prior to acceptance of a dissertation based on such research. The same holds true for dissertations involving animals. The dissertation requirement is designed to develop the capacities of originality and generalization in the candidate. It should foster and attest to the development in the candidate of ability in scientiﬁc inquiry, understanding and proﬁciency in the techniques of scholarship, and the art of exposition within the ﬁeld of specialization. The dissertation committee, with such other professors as may be appointed by the Dean of the Graduate School, shall examine the dissertation. No dissertation shall be accepted unless it secures unanimous approval of the dissertation committee. It is expected that the dissertation will serve to demonstrate the student's ability to contribute to the development of research or scholarship within the discipline. As such, a successful defense certiﬁes that the dissertation is a demonstration of the student's ability to identify a problem, develop a methodology, carry out the necessary steps to gather data, analyze the ﬁndings, and form a defensible conclusion. In the case of non-traditional dissertations that may contain chapters or sections with multiple authors, it is necessary to clarify the contribution of the dissertating student and others who may contribute to the dissertation. (See Dissertation Proposal Approval under Milestones for Doctoral Programs.) It is expected that the dissertating student will be identiﬁed as the primary author of each of the chapters. The introduction to the dissertation must be solely authored by the dissertating student and must contain the theoretical framework that uniﬁes the chapters that follow. The dissertating student also must be the sole author of the concluding chapter in which the signiﬁcance of the various articles is explained. It is also expected that within the dissertation, appropriate attribution will be given to the other authors who contribute to the chapters. Oral Defense of the Dissertation The doctoral candidate who has successfully completed all other requirements for the degree must defend the dissertation orally in a public format. The defense will be scheduled by the chair of the dissertation committee in consultation with the other committee members. Without permission from the entire doctoral committee, the ﬁnal oral defense may not take place during regularly scheduled University holidays and breaks. Students must submit the dissertation title, date, time and location of the oral defense at least two weeks prior for publication by the Graduate School. Defenses should not be scheduled during holidays, or at other times faculty and students are not regularly expected on campus. The dissertation committee administers the oral defense according to program guidelines. The defense is open to all members of the University community who may wish to attend, as required by state laws on public meetings. However, the deliberations of the Dissertation Committee are private. The results of the defense are to be reported in writing to the Dean of the Graduate School. It is not uncommon for a student to be required to complete additional work on the dissertation after a successful defense. The Doctoral Committee Chair should sign the dissertation approval page only after the student has satisﬁed the required additional work. Committees should not pass a student on a defense if the additional work required is signiﬁcant. Filing the Final Approved Dissertation Students ﬁle the dissertation electronically via the online submission system available on the Graduate School’s website. The dissertation must comply with the rules prescribed by the Graduate Council in the templates for preparing theses and dissertations. The approved electronic submission must be uploaded by the deadline as speciﬁed in the Academic Calendar. Students submit their dissertation via the online submission system available on the Graduate School’s website (http://grs.uncg.edu/ enrolled/etd/). The submission must conform to UNC Greensboro’s formatting requirements and must be uploaded by the deadline dates as speciﬁed in the Academic Calendar. The Graduate School requires all approved dissertations to be published through UMI Dissertation Publishing/ProQuest Information and Learning. There is no charge for basic publishing; however, optional services requested by the candidate during submission may have associated charges. The Graduate School requires students to publish their dissertation with UMI Dissertation Publishing/ProQuest Information and Learning. All students' dissertations are also published on NC DOCKS. There is no charge for traditional publishing; however, optional services may incur charges. The process for submitting an approved dissertation to the Graduate School has two components: 1) Submitting the signed approval copy and 2) Submitting the ﬁnal copy. Speciﬁc instructions afﬁliated with each step are available on the Graduate School's website (http://grs.uncg.edu/ enrolled/etd/); deadline dates are available in the Academic Calendar (https://reg.uncg.edu/calendars/). Important note: Dissertation hours vary according to the program but are never fewer than twelve (12) semester hours, normally taken in units of three (3) semester hours. Students who have exhausted all available dissertation hours but remain unﬁnished will be placed in extension status.  UNC Greensboro 2023-24 University Catalog 835 Time Limits for Graduate Degrees Time Limits for Certiﬁcates Certiﬁcates awarded from UNCG indicate that our students have current, usable knowledge in their ﬁeld; therefore, the certiﬁcate curriculum, including the optional capstone, must be completed within three academic years, from the date of the ﬁrst courses carrying graduate credit applicable to the student’s program are begun. Students who are concurrently enrolled in a degree program and certiﬁcate must complete the certiﬁcate during the time limits of that degree. Time Limits for Master's Degrees Advanced degrees awarded from UNCG indicate that students have current, usable knowledge in their ﬁeld; therefore, the master’s curriculum, including the thesis, must be completed within ﬁve academic years, from the date the ﬁrst courses carrying graduate degree credit applicable to the student’s program are begun. Time Limits for Master of Fine Arts Degrees Advanced degrees awarded from UNCG indicate that students have current, usable knowledge in their ﬁeld; therefore, the M.F.A. curriculum, including the capstone, must be completed within ﬁve academic years, from the date the ﬁrst courses carrying graduate degree credit applicable to the student’s program are begun. Time Limit for Master's Doctoral Track Programs Advanced degrees awarded from UNCG indicate that students have current, usable knowledge in their ﬁeld; therefore, doctoral track curriculum, including the dissertation, must be completed within ten academic years from the date the ﬁrst courses carrying graduate degree credit applicable to the student’s program are begun. Time Limits for Doctoral Degrees Advanced degrees awarded from UNCG indicate that students have current, usable knowledge in their ﬁeld; therefore, all requirements for the doctorate, including the dissertation, must be completed within seven academic years. Post-master’s (or equivalent) credit that is to be applied to the student’s doctoral program must be no more than seven years old when the degree requirements are completed. This means that all course work to be credited to the student’s doctoral program must fall within a seven-year period beginning with the date the ﬁrst courses carrying graduate-degree credit applicable to the student’s program are begun. If credit to be transferred was earned before enrollment at this University, the seven-year period commences with the beginning date of the term in which the transfer credit was earned. The seven-year time limit does not apply to students who are admitted to a Doctoral Track Program (combined master’s/doctoral). In this case, the time limit is ten years. Semester Hours Required for Graduate Degrees Consistent with regional accreditation by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC), UNCG requires a minimum of thirty (30) hours beyond the bachelor’s degree for any master’s degree, sixty (60) hours for doctoral programs that award a master’s as part of the doctoral degree requirements, and forty-ﬁve (45) credits minimum for direct entry doctoral programs that do not require a student to earn a master’s degree. • Minimum semester-hour requirements, which vary by the program, are stated under the respective departmental program description in the University Catalog. • Credit that is applied toward completion of one degree cannot be applied to another degree. • No course below the 500 level will be counted towards graduate degree requirements. • In all programs, at least one half of the work credited toward the degree must be in 600-level courses or above.  836 Undergraduate Policies Undergraduate Policies • Academic Requirements and Limits for Undergraduates (p. 836) • Academic Standing at UNC Greensboro (p. 836) • Classiﬁcation of Students (p. 838) • Course Credit Regulations and Limits (p. 838) • Course Selection (p. 839) • Course Withdrawal Policy (p. 840) • Grading (p. 840) • Academic Renewal (p. 841) • Chancellor’s List (p. 841) • Credit Hours (p. 841) • Dean's List (p. 841) • Final Course Examinations (p. 841) • Grade Points and Grade Point Averages (GPA) (p. 841) • Grade Replacement Policy (p. 842) • Grade Reports (p. 842) • Grades (p. 842) • Incomplete Grades (p. 843) • Retroactive Grade Change (p. 843) • Undergraduate Final Grade Appeal Policy (p. 844) • Honors for Second Degree Recipients and Transfer Students (p. 844) • Majors, Minors, Double Majors and Simultaneous Degrees Policy (p. 844) • Steps to Graduation (p. 845) • Withdrawal from the University (p. 846) Academic Requirements and Limits for Undergraduates Baccalaureate Degree Requirements and Limits 120 - Minimum number of credit hours required for an undergraduate degree 36 - Minimum number of credits required toward the degree at or above the 300 course level 31 - Minimum required credits in residence at UNC Greensboro 31 - Minimum required credits in residence at UNC Greensboro beyond the ﬁrst degree for a second undergraduate degree 2.0 - Minimum cumulative GPA required for graduation Credit Hour Regulations and Limits 12 - Minimum number of credits in which undergraduates must enroll per semester to qualify for full-time status 18 - Maximum number of credits per semester in which an undergraduate may enroll without special permission 64 - Maximum number of credits allowed for 2-year transfer credit 12 - Maximum number of credits allowed for physical education credit Dean's List Qualiﬁcations 6 - Minimum number of credits a student must have completed at UNC Greensboro to be eligible for Dean's List 6 - Minimum number of credits in which a student must be enrolled for a given semester 3.50 - Minimum required GPA for the semester B-  - Minimum grade earned for the semester (no grade may be lower than B-) Chancellor’s List Qualiﬁcations 30 - Minimum number of credits a student must have completed at UNC Greensboro to be eligible for Chancellor’s List 12 - Minimum number of credits in which a student must be enrolled for a given semester at UNC Greensboro 3.65 - Minimum required cumulative GPA Transfer students must be enrolled for at least one semester at UNC Greensboro to be eligible for the Chancellor’s List.

Academic Standing at UNC Greensboro The following requirements and procedures for maintaining academic good standing became effective in Fall 2017 for undergraduate students and was modiﬁed by Faculty Senate in April 2017. Undergraduate students are expected to be aware at all times of their academic standing and are responsible for knowing whether or not they are on Academic Good Standing, Academic Warning, Academic Probation, Academic Suspension, or Academic Dismissal. Students may check their academic standing via UNCGenie. UNC Greensboro reserves the right to deny enrollment to any student, even though the student has met the minimum grade point average required, if it is apparent from the student’s academic record of required courses that the student will not be able to meet graduation requirements.  UNC Greensboro 2023-24 University Catalog 837 The Academic Good Standing Policy applies to enrollment during any term, including summer term. Students may be placed on Academic Warning, Academic Probation, Academic Suspension, Academic Dismissal, or restored to Academic Good Standing based on their academic performance during Summer Session. Academic performance for both summer terms is evaluated at the end of Summer Session II. Academic Good Standing Policy (For degree-seeking students entering the university Fall 2014 and after. Students who entered the university as degree-seeking undergraduates prior to Fall 2014 are grandfathered into the policy last published in the 2013–14 Undergraduate Bulletin.) To maintain Academic Good Standing at UNC Greensboro, undergraduate students will be required to satisfy all of the following requirements: • Maintain a minimum 2.0 cumulative GPA. • Earn 67% of their credit hours each term. Failure to satisfy all of the requirements above will result in Academic Warning or Academic Probation. Academic Warning Academic Warning will occur when an undergraduate student maintains a minimum 2.0 cumulative GPA but earns less than 67% of their credits. Students who fall on Academic Warning will be required to satisfy all of the following requirements during their next term of enrollment: • Maintain a minimum 2.0 cumulative GPA. • Earn 67% of their credits each term. • Enroll in and successfully complete the requirements of the Academic Resources & Knowledge (ARK) Program. Failure to meet the requirements for Academic Good Standing while on Academic Warning may result in Academic Probation. A student who is able to maintain a 2.0 cumulative GPA but does not earn 67% of their credits will continue on Academic Warning each consecutive semester until the required minimum percentage of hours is earned. Academic Probation Academic Probation will occur when an undergraduate student in Academic Good Standing or on Academic Warning fails to maintain a minimum 2.0 cumulative GPA. Undergraduate students who fall on Academic Probation will be required to satisfy all of the following requirements during their next term of enrollment: • Limit enrollment to a maximum of 16 credits each fall and spring term and 8 credits in the summer term until Academic Good Standing is restored. • Earn a minimum 2.30 term GPA each term until a 2.0 cumulative GPA is restored. • Enroll in and successfully complete the requirements of ARS 100. Failure to satisfy all of the Academic Probation requirements above may result in Academic Suspension at the end of the probationary term. A student who is able to restore a 2.0 cumulative GPA but does not earn 67% of their credits will be placed on Academic Warning. In cases where circumstances beyond the student’s control have interfered with the student’s academic performance, students placed on Academic Suspension may request immediate reinstatement by submitting an Academic Suspension Appeal. Contact the Students First Ofﬁce, Forney Student Success Commons—Suite 101, 336-334-5730, for more information on the appeal process. Academic Suspension Academic Suspension will occur when an undergraduate student on Academic Probation fails to maintain either a minimum 2.30 term GPA or a minimum 2.0 cumulative GPA All students who fall on Academic Suspension are ineligible to enroll at UNC Greensboro for one fall or spring term. NOTE: Summer Session is not considered a term away for the purposes of Academic Suspension. After a one-term suspension, students may apply for readmission to the university via the Ofﬁce of Undergraduate Admissions. If readmitted, upon return from Academic Suspension, an undergraduate student will be considered on Academic Probation and is required to satisfy all of the following requirements during their next term of enrollment: • Limit enrollment to a maximum of 16 credits each fall and spring term and 8 credits in the summer term until Academic Good Standing is restored. • Earn a minimum 2.30 term GPA each term until a 2.0 cumulative GPA is restored. • Enroll in and successfully complete the requirements of ARS 120. Failure to satisfy all of the Academic Suspension requirements above may result in Academic Dismissal at the end of the term. A student who is able to restore a 2.0 cumulative GPA but does not earn 67% of their semester hours will be placed on Academic Warning. In cases where circumstances beyond the student’s control have interfered with the student’s academic performance, students placed on Academic Dismissal may request immediate reinstatement by submitting an Academic Dismissal Appeal. Contact the Students First Ofﬁce, Forney Student Success Commons—Suite 101, 336-334-5730, for more information on the appeal process. Academic Dismissal Academic Dismissal will occur when an undergraduate student on Academic Probation after returning from Academic Suspension fails to maintain either a minimum 2.30 term GPA or a minimum 2.0 cumulative GPA. All students who fall on Academic Dismissal are ineligible to enroll at UNC Greensboro for one academic year. NOTE: Summer session is not considered a term away for the purposes of Academic Dismissal. After a one-year dismissal, students may request permission to return to the university by submitting a Return from Academic Dismissal Appeal and must apply for readmission to the university via the Ofﬁce of Undergraduate Admissions. Contact the Students First Ofﬁce, Forney Student Success Commons—Suite 101, 336-334-5730, for more information on the appeal and readmission process. If readmitted, upon return from Academic Dismissal, an undergraduate student will be considered on Academic Probation and is required  838 Classiﬁcation of Students to satisfy all of the following requirements during their next term of enrollment: • Limit enrollment to a maximum of 16 credits each fall and spring term and 8 credits in the summer term until Academic Good Standing is restored. • Earn a minimum 2.30 term GPA each term until a 2.0 cumulative GPA is restored. • Enroll in and successfully complete the requirements of ARS 140. Failure to satisfy all of the Academic Dismissal requirements above may result in Academic Dismissal at the end of the term. A student who is able to restore a 2.0 cumulative GPA but does not earn 67% of their semester hours will be placed on Academic Warning. In cases where circumstances beyond the student’s control have interfered with the student’s academic performance, students placed on Academic Dismissal may request immediate reinstatement by submitting an Academic Dismissal Appeal. Contact the Students First Ofﬁce, Forney Student Success Commons—Suite 101, 336-334-5730, for more information on the appeal process. Academic Appeals In cases where circumstances beyond the student’s control have interfered with the student’s academic performance, students placed on Academic Suspension or Academic Dismissal may request immediate reinstatement by submitting an Academic Suspension Appeal or Academic Dismissal Appeal. Appeals must be submitted by the published deadlines, which are located in the academic calendar and the University Catalog. Events and/or circumstances that merit an appeal include ofﬁcially documented unanticipated personal life events, ofﬁcially documented unanticipated serious medical difﬁculty, and/or ofﬁcially documented serious psychological difﬁculty. Students are strongly encouraged to contact the Students First Ofﬁce for assistance before ofﬁcially submitting an appeal. An Academic Suspension Appeal or Academic Dismissal Appeal will be reviewed by the Academic Appeals Committee, which is convened by the Division of Student Success and the Ofﬁce of the Dean of Undergraduate Studies. Once an appeal has been submitted and reviewed, students will be notiﬁed of the results of their appeal via their UNC Greensboro email account. All academic appeal decisions are ﬁnal. As mandated by the university, a student whose Academic Suspension Appeal or Academic Dismissal Appeal is approved must agree to participate in the designated Academic Recovery Program, coordinated within the Students First Ofﬁce, during the next term of enrollment. Failure to participate in and successfully complete the requirements of the designated Academic Recovery Program will result in immediate Academic Dismissal at the end of the term. Classiﬁcation of Students The following classiﬁcations became effective for fall 1996 and thereafter for newly admitted undergraduates (transfer students and freshmen). Undergraduate students are classiﬁed as freshmen, sophomores, juniors, and seniors. These classiﬁcations are determined by the number of credit hours completed (including hours transferred from another institution). The classiﬁcations are as follows: Classiﬁcation Semester Hours Freshman 0–29.9 credits completed Sophomore 30–59.9 credits completed Junior 60–89.9 credits completed Senior 90 or more credits completed Course Credit Regulations and Limits Correspondence Credit Up to 64 credit hours in correspondence and extension credit may be applied to the completion of work for an undergraduate degree with the further stipulation that not more than one-fourth of the requirements for the degree may be completed in correspondence credit. Academic departments may establish such course and credit limitations in acceptance of correspondence credit as may be required by speciﬁc degree programs. Although UNC Greensboro correspondence credit is treated as transfer credit at the time of admission, it will be thereafter considered “Residence” credit for degree certiﬁcation purposes. Correspondence credit earned from institutions other than UNC Greensboro is always treated as transfer credit. It will have no impact on the UNC Greensboro grade point average. Only credits will be applied toward UNC Greensboro degree requirements. Extension Credit UNC Greensboro extension credit, earned either on or off campus, will be considered transfer credit for admission purposes. Up to 64 credit hours in extension and/or correspondence credits may be applied to completion of work for an undergraduate degree. Academic departments may establish such course and credit limitations in acceptance of extension credit as may be required by speciﬁc degree programs. Although UNC Greensboro extension credit is treated as transfer credit at the time of admission, it will be thereafter considered “Residence” credit for degree certiﬁcation purposes. Non-Credit Courses Non-credit courses do not count toward graduation nor are they calculated in the student’s GPA. There are currently no non-credit courses available. Physical Education Credit Limit Policy Any university student may take up to 12 credit hours of elective credit in physical education activity courses to apply toward graduation. Repeated Courses If a course or its equivalent is taken more than once for credit and is not repeatable for credit, credit will be applied toward degree requirements only once. Summer Session Credit Students may enroll for no more than seven credits during each of the two summer sessions, unless permitted to take an increased load by their assigned academic advisor. Advanced Placement Credit (AP Credit) In compliance with the UNC system policy 700.10.1 [R], UNC Greensboro accepts Advanced Placement (AP) Exam Scores from the College Board for scores of three or higher on one or more AP Exam(s). To help improve  UNC Greensboro 2023-24 University Catalog 839 student’s completion and progression towards a degree, qualiﬁed AP Exam(s) Score will be awarded for speciﬁc credit hours aligned with the equivalent UNCG course(s). A list of corresponding credits and accepted scores may be found on the University Registrar’s Ofﬁce website. Transfer Credit Comprehensive Articulation Agreement The North Carolina General Assembly, the Board of Governors of The University of North Carolina, and the State Board of Community Colleges are committed to the simpliﬁcation of transfer of credits for students and thus facilitating their educational progress as they pursue associate or baccalaureate degrees within and among public post- secondary institutions in North Carolina. The Comprehensive Articulation Agreement (CAA) is a statewide agreement governing the transfer of credits between N.C. community colleges and public universities in North Carolina, and has as its objective the smooth transfer of students, providing certain assurances to the transferring student by identifying community college courses that are appropriate for transfer as electives, and specifying courses that will satisfy pre-major and general education requirements. The CAA establishes the procedures governing the transfer of credits for students who transfer from a North Carolina Community College to a constituent institution of The University of North Carolina. To be eligible for the transfer of credits under the CAA, the student must graduate from the community college with an Associate in Arts (AA) or Associate in Science (AS) degree and have an overall Grade Point Average (GPA) of at least 2.0 on a 4.0 scale and a grade of ""C"" or better in all CAA courses. Students who do not complete the degree are eligible to transfer credits on a course-by-course basis. Students ofﬁcially enrolled in an AA or AS program at a North Carolina community college prior to Fall Semester 2014 are subject to the conditions and protections contained in the CAA in place at the time of their initial enrollment as long as they have remained continuously enrolled Community college graduates of the Associate in Arts or Associate in Science degree programs who have earned 60 semester hours in approved transfer courses with a grade of “C” or better will receive at least 60 semester hours of academic credit upon admission to UNC Greensboro. A student who completes the Associate in Arts or Associate in Science degree prior to transfer to UNC Greensboro will have fulﬁlled the university's lower-division general education requirements, but not intermediate-level general education requirements like the College of Arts and Sciences' foreign language requirement. Also, due to degree requirements in some majors, additional lower-division courses at UNC Greensboro may be required beyond the general education courses and pre-major courses taken at the community college. If a student from a North Carolina Community College System (NCCCS) college believes the terms of the Comprehensive Articulation Agreement (CAA) have not been honored by UNC Greensboro, the student may invoke the CAA Transfer Credit Appeal Procedure. Steps to ﬁle an appeal can be found in Appendix E of the Comprehensive Articulation Agreement document (https://www.nccommunitycolleges.edu/academic-programs/ college-transferarticulation-agreements/comprehensive-articulation- agreement-caa (https://www.nccommunitycolleges.edu/academic- programs/college-transferarticulation-agreements/comprehensive- articulation-agreement-caa/)) Transfer Credit and Credit Limit UNC Greensboro is accredited by and will accept transfer credit from schools accredited by the Commission on Colleges, Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC). Colleges and universities outside of the SACSCOC region must have accreditation from the Accrediting Commission for Community and Junior Colleges (ACCJC) Western Association of Schools and Colleges, Higher Learning Commission (HLC), Middle States Commission on Higher Education (MSCHE), New England Commission of Higher Education (NECHE), Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities (NWCCU), Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC), or WASC Senior College and University Commission (WSCUC) for the transfer credit to be accepted. Transfer credit to be awarded is determined by the quality as well as the quantity of the student’s previous college work. Course work completed with a grade of C-, D+, D, or D- will not transfer. Transfer courses are evaluated on a course-by-course basis. The sum total of transfer credit hours from two-year college(s), extension, or correspondence courses that may be applied toward an undergraduate degree may not exceed 64 semester hours. No combination of 2Plus and transfer/extension credit may exceed 64 semester hours on the student’s transfer equivalency worksheet. The University’s Repeated Course policy applies to transfer credit. If a course or its equivalent is taken more than once for credit and is not repeatable for credit, credit will be applied toward degree requirements only once. In the case of duplicate transfer credit, only the ﬁrst instance in which credit can be awarded will remain on the UNC Greensboro academic record. Current UNC Greensboro policy stipulates that courses completed in technical, vocational, or professional programs at community colleges or courses from technical colleges or proprietary institutions cannot be accepted in transfer, unless they are part of a 2Plus Program. These programs give students with articulated Associate in Applied Science degrees access to a limited number of degrees at UNC Greensboro. Credit for Military Training Elective credit for military training may be awarded where UNC Greensboro has comparable courses and upon receipt of an ofﬁcial American Council of Education transcript. Course Selection Adding Courses Students may add courses to their schedules during the Drop/Add period. Between the end of the Drop/Add period and the 10th day of classes, a student desiring to add a course may do so only with the written approval of the instructor. Late Adds After the 10th day of classes, adding with instructor permission will be accepted by the University Registrar’s Ofﬁce only under extraordinary circumstances. Course Levels Course level numbers are structured as follows: Course Level Number Description 100-199 Intended primarily for freshmen 200-299 Intended primarily for sophomores 300-399 Intended primarily for juniors 400-499 Intended primarily for seniors 500–599 For all graduate students  840 Course Withdrawal Policy 600-749 For all graduate students, including doctoral 750-799 Doctoral level only Course Loads Twelve credit hours is considered full-time status for undergraduates. An undergraduate student must be enrolled for a minimum of 12 credits to qualify for full-time certiﬁcation to any organization. Full-time undergraduates normally take ﬁve courses per semester. Since a majority of courses carry three hours of credit with some carrying four hours of credit, a normal course load is 15 or 16 credits per semester. To complete most undergraduate degrees in four years, students should plan to carry 15 or 16 credits per semester. Undergraduates may not take more than 18 credits per semester except with the approval of their assigned academic advisor. Students who have cumulative grade point averages of 3.0 may be authorized, in special circumstances and at the discretion of the Dean of Undergraduate Studies, to carry a maximum of 21 credits of course work. Suggested Academic Workload Guidelines Students should be aware that academic excellence and scholastic achievement usually require a signiﬁcant investment of time in study, research, and out-of-class projects. To provide guidance to students in planning their academic and work schedules, the following recommendations are offered: 1. In general, students should plan to devote between 2–3 hours outside of class for each hour in class. Thus, students with a 15 credits course load should schedule between 30–45 hours weekly for completing outside-of-class reading, study, and homework assignments. 2. Students who are employed more than 5–10 hours each week should consider reducing their course loads (semester hours), depending upon their study habits, learning abilities, and course work requirements. Course Withdrawal Policy The following requirements and procedures for maintaining Academic Good Standing became effective in Fall 1996 for newly admitted degree-seeking undergraduates (freshmen and transfer students), modiﬁed by Faculty Senate in April 1998 and modiﬁed again in November 2013 in compliance with UNC Policy 400.1.1[R]. Withdrawing from Current Term Courses 16 credit hour limit for course withdrawals Beginning Fall 2014, all undergraduate students will be limited to withdrawing from a maximum of 16 credit hours during their undergraduate career. This limitation does not include course withdrawals completed within the course adjustment period (as identiﬁed on the Academic Calendar) that do not count as attempted hours and are not limited to 16 credits . Students who have not exceeded their 16 credit limit may withdraw from a course or courses after the course adjustment period and within the ﬁrst eight weeks of the term without incurring a WF grade (Withdrawn Failing). Withdrawal from courses within the 16 credit limit will be indicated on a transcript with a grade of WX. Course withdrawals after eight weeks or in excess of 16 credits will incur a WF grade (Withdrawn Failing). Courses of less than one semester’s duration, including Summer School courses, shall have shorter withdrawal deadlines (proportional to the course adjustment and eight-week deadline for the regular semester). All withdrawal deadlines are published on the University Registrar’s Ofﬁce website. All WX courses count as attempted hours and are subject to academic standing, ﬁnancial aid, and Satisfactory Academic Progress rules and calculations. Withdrawing from a Course with Extenuating Circumstances Undergraduate students with appropriate cause, as determined by ofﬁcially documented military deployment, medical, psychological, or unanticipated personal life events, or administrative reasons, may petition for an exemption from the 16 credit limit and the eight- week deadline by initiating an Appeal to Withdraw for Extenuating Circumstances (formerly Course Withdrawal Request) through the Students First Ofﬁce. The Appeal to Withdraw for Extenuating Circumstances Committee, under the purview of the Division of Student Success, shall be responsible for authorizing Appeals to Withdraw for Extenuating Circumstances in consultation with the instructor of every course, and with other departments or agencies as needed. If an Appeal to Withdraw for Extenuating Circumstances is authorized, all requested courses will be indicated on a transcript with a grade of WE (Withdrawn with Exception). If a student withdraws from all courses, the student is considered ofﬁcially withdrawn from the university. See section on Withdrawal from the University. All WE courses count as attempted hours and are subject to ﬁnancial aid and Satisfactory Academic Progression rules and calculations; they do not count in academic standing calculations or GPA calculation. Withdrawing from Courses Retroactively Undergraduate students shall be given one year following the term in which a course or courses were taken to submit an Appeal to Withdraw for Extenuating Circumstances with the Division of Student Success. Students who seek to withdraw from a course or courses retroactively must meet the conditions under Withdrawing from Current Term Courses and the Appeal to Withdraw for Extenuating Circumstances Committee, under the purview of the Division of Student Success, must authorize the request. Students are strongly encouraged to contact the Students First Ofﬁce for assistance before ofﬁcially submitting an Appeal to Withdraw for Extenuating Circumstances. If an Appeal to Withdraw for Extenuating Circumstances is authorized, all requested courses will be indicated on a transcript with a grade of W (Withdrawn) for classes taken prior to Fall 2014, and a grade of WE (Withdrawn Exception) for courses taken in Fall 2014 and thereafter. Students who have graduated may not withdraw from courses retroactively. Neither the course withdrawal (WX) nor the course withdrawal with an exception (WE) can be replaced under the university’s Grade Replacement Policy or forgiven as part of the Academic Renewal Policy.

Academic Renewal allows formerly enrolled students who have been readmitted the possibility of having grades earned during their previous attendance period to be forgiven (excluded from GPA calculations). Students initiate the request for Academic Renewal by ﬁling a form with the Students First Ofﬁce. Formerly enrolled students who left UNC Greensboro with a cumulative GPA below 2.00 may pre-qualify for academic renewal when: • they have not been enrolled in any institution of higher education for a minimum of one year (one fall and one spring semester); or, as an alternative: • they have completed 24 credit hours of transferrable college credit with a 2.50 GPA since their last enrollment at UNC Greensboro. Upon being readmitted and/or reactivated under the provisions of this policy, pre-qualiﬁed students may apply for Academic Renewal after earning at least a 2.30 GPA on their ﬁrst 12 credits following re- enrollment. If a student earns fewer than 12 credits in their ﬁrst term after re-enrollment, all hours and grades earned in consecutive terms (concluding with the term in which the 12 credits total is reached) will be considered for this requirement. If a student earns more than 12 credits in the ﬁrst term after re-enrollment, all hours and grades earned in that term will be considered for the GPA requirement. Thereafter, the student must meet the standard for continuation in the university Academic Good Standing policy. All Academic Renewal requests should be submitted to the Students First Ofﬁce and will be reviewed for approval by the Academic Renewal Review Committee. Upon meeting the Academic Renewal requirements, previously completed courses in which grades of a D+ or below were earned will be forgiven. The recomputed GPA will be calculated from the courses in which grades of C- or higher were earned. All courses taken will appear on the academic record and count toward attempted hours. Grades will be forgiven only once during a student’s career and cannot be reversed. Students who receive approval for an Academic Renewal Request cannot utilize the Grade Replacement Policy in future semesters. Chancellor’s List Undergraduate students are eligible for the Chancellor’s List who meet the following criteria: • achievement of 30 or more credits at UNC Greensboro • a cumulative grade point average of 3.65 or higher • current enrollment at UNC Greensboro in 12 or more credits • be in Academic Good Standing In the case of transfer students, at least one semester of enrollment at UNC Greensboro is required. Recognition is accorded the recipients of this honor. The Chancellor’s List is published on the University Registrar’s website after all grades have been processed for the respective fall or spring term. The achievement also appears on the academic transcript. Credit Hours Credits for all courses are reported in credit hours. A credit hour credit equals one 50-minute class period per week or its equivalent throughout one semester. The number of credits given for each course is listed as part of the course description. Dean's List Undergraduate students are eligible for the Dean's List who meet the following criteria: • carry six or more credits of course work graded on an A, B, C, D, or F basis • earn a grade point average of 3.50 or better and have no grade below B- for the semester • be in Academic Good Standing The list is compiled at the end of each semester or when a grade change is processed after a semester for all students whose grade point average falls within the range at the time the report is prepared. Recognition is accorded the recipients of this honor. The Dean's List is published on the University Registrar’s website after all grades have been processed for the respective fall or spring term. The achievement also appears on the academic transcript. Final Course Examinations Final examinations may be required at the discretion of faculty and must be scheduled in course syllabi with information available to students on the ﬁrst day of class. Change of Examination Schedule A student desiring to change the meeting time of a ﬁnal exam should make the request directly to the class instructor. It is the instructor’s prerogative to grant such requests. In instances where students have more than two exams within a 24-hour period, they may apply to the University Registrar’s Ofﬁce, 180 Mossman Building, for permission to change their exam schedules. The usual process is to change the middle examination in a sequence of three. All requests for changes in examinations must be ﬁled with the University Registrar’s Ofﬁce before Reading Day. Grade Points and Grade Point Averages (GPA) UNC Greensboro uses a credit hour and grade point system for evaluating undergraduates. Credit hours represent the number of  842 Grade Replacement Policy course hours completed. Grade points are determined by the number of credits attempted and the grades earned. The grade point average is determined by dividing the accumulated number of grade points earned by the accumulated number of semester hours undertaken. Hours attempted but not passed must be included in this calculation. However, a second F or WF in the same course is not used in computing the grade point average. Courses graded on the P/NP or S/U basis and courses transferred from another institution may not be used in determining the UNC Greensboro grade point average. Courses taken through cross-registration with another institution are considered transfer credits. Grades do not appear on the UNC Greensboro transcript and are not calculated in the GPA. Beginning with courses taken in Fall 1996, plus/minus grades are incorporated into the GPA for all undergraduates. Grade Grade Points Awarded Per Hour of Credit A 4.0 A- 3.7 B+ 3.3 B 3.0 B- 2.7 C+ 2.3 C 2.0 C- 1.7 D+ 1.3 D 1.0 D- 0.7 F/WF 0.0 Grade Replacement Policy Revised and approved by the Faculty Senate on April 28, 2021. A UNCG undergraduate student can request permission to use the Grade Replacement Policy for up to four (4) courses (maximum of 16 credit hours) in which they have earned a grade of C-, D+, D, D- or F/WF. * In cases where a Grade Replacement Request is permitted, the original grade in a UNCG course will be removed from the Grade Point Average (GPA) calculation and replaced by the grade earned in the repeated UNCG course. However, all ﬁnal grades and attempted credits from all course attempts will remain on a student’s permanent academic transcript and calculated in determining eligibility for academic majors and ﬁnancial aid satisfactory academic progress (as applicable). The following exclusions will prohibit students from using the Grade Replacement Policy from speciﬁc courses: • Courses in which the ﬁnal grade earned was the result of an Academic Integrity violation, which are recorded by the Ofﬁce of Student Rights and Responsibilities • Courses taken in future semesters once a student has applied and been approved for the Academic Renewal Policy • Grade Replacement Requests submitted after a degree is conferred Grade Replacement is permitted for courses that have undergone course preﬁx or course number changes through the Undergraduate Curriculum process. Students must initiate a Grade Replacement Request by ﬁling a Grade Replacement Request form with the University Registrar’s Ofﬁce. Once processed, all grade replacements are ﬁnal and can only be reversed by approved appeal. In the case of all other repeated courses in which the Grade Replacement Policy is not utilized, attempted credits and grade points from all attempts will be counted fully in the GPA; however, credits earned for the course will count only once in the total hours for the degree. Appeals for any exceptions to the parameters above, including requests to use Grade Replacement for courses in which a student has earned a C or higher, must be submitted in writing to the Ofﬁce of the Dean of Undergraduate Studies in the Division of Student Success for consideration prior to registering for the repeat course. * Due to the academic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, courses originally taken or repeated in Spring 2020, Summer 2020, Fall 2020, and Spring 2021 semesters will not count against the four (4) course maximum number of Grade Replacements permitted by this policy. Grade Reports Final course grades are made available to students at the end of each semester on UNCGenie, UNC Greensboro’s student information system. Students can view and print copies of their grades from UNCGenie. Grades A grade in a course is based on the quality of the student’s classroom and written work throughout the semester. Most course grades are not solely based on the ﬁnal examination alone. If a course or its equivalent is taken more than once for credit and is not repeatable for credit, credit will be applied toward degree requirements only once. Grading System For Undergraduates Grade Description A Excellent—indicates achievement of distinction and excellence in several if not all of the following aspects: 1) completeness and accuracy of knowledge; 2) intelligent use of knowledge; 3) independence of work; 4) originality. B Good—indicates general achievement superior to the acceptable standard deﬁned as C. It involves excellence in some aspects of the work, as indicated in the deﬁnition of A.  UNC Greensboro 2023-24 University Catalog 843 C Average—indicates the acceptable standard for graduation from UNC Greensboro. It involves such quality and quantity of work as may fairly be expected of a student of normal ability who gives to the course a reasonable amount of time, effort, and attention. D Lowest Passing Grade—indicates work that falls below the acceptable standards deﬁned as C but which is of sufﬁcient quality and quantity to be counted in the hours of graduation if balanced by superior work in other courses. F Failure—indicates failure that may not be made up except by repeating the course. I Incomplete—indicates that the completion of some part of the work for the course has been deferred because of prolonged illness of the student or because of some serious circumstances beyond the student’s control. Concomitantly with the recording of an Incomplete grade, the instructor ﬁles with the head of the school or department concerned the student’s average grade and the speciﬁc work that must be accomplished before the Incomplete can be removed. Incomplete grades may be recommended by the university physician, the Counseling and Testing Center, and by the Dean of Undergraduate Studies. See also the topic Incomplete Grades in this section. IP In Progress—indicates that the course work was planned to continue beyond a single semester. NC No Credit—indicates an audited course. NR Not Reported—indicates a ﬁnal grade was not submitted prior to the ofﬁcial end of the semester according to the university’s academic calendar. P/NP Passing/Not Passing—used for designated courses only; courses graded P/NP are so indicated in the course description. SA Satisfactory SP Special Exam US Unsatisfactory W Withdrawal—indicates a course from which the student withdrew during the ﬁrst eight (8) weeks of classes; no academic penalty is attached to a grade of W; see also Course Withdrawal. WE Withdrawal Without Penalty— Individual Course WF Withdrawal with Failure—indicates a course from which the student withdrew after the ﬁrst eight (8) weeks of classes; a WF is computed in the student’s GPA; see also Course Withdrawal. WM Withdrawal Without Penalty—Full Term, Military WN Withdrawal Not Passing—used in courses designated P/NP. WT Withdrawal Without Penalty—Full Term WX Withdrawal With Penalty Incomplete Grades An Incomplete grade may be removed by completion of the deferred work. The time line for which all deferred work must be submitted by a student is determined at the discretion of the instructor and should be clearly outlined via a written document summarizing the course work to be completed and any deadlines for submission. A student should not re-register for the course in order to remove the Incomplete. An Incomplete received during a semester or in summer session must be removed within six months from the last day of examinations in the term in which the course was taken. This deadline indicates the ﬁnal date that an instructor may submit a grade change to remove the incomplete grade. The parameters for removing an incomplete grade, including any deadlines for which work must be submitted by a student, are at the discretion of the instructor. An incomplete not removed within this time limit is automatically converted to an F on the student’s academic record by the University Registrar's Ofﬁce. A graduating senior who incurs an incomplete and who has completed all requirements and enough semester hour credits and grade points to graduate may do so even though the Incomplete grade is outstanding. If the Incomplete is not removed within the required six months, it will be converted to F at the end of that period of time. When an Incomplete is removed, it may be replaced by A, B, C, D, F, or, in certain designated courses, P, NP, S, or U. Retroactive Grade Change A retroactive grade change is a change in an ofﬁcially recorded grade. A grade becomes ofﬁcially recorded when the Registrar so stipulates. Except to correct clerical errors or to resolve an incomplete grade (see Incomplete Grades), a retroactive grade change is an extraordinary action and is granted only in the most compelling circumstances. No change may occur unless the instructor who gave the grade initiates the formal process of a retroactive grade change. The change must also be approved by the instructor’s department head and by the instructor’s dean.  844 Undergraduate Final Grade Appeal Policy Students who seek a retroactive grade change to a W are referred to the section on Withdrawing from Courses Retroactively in the Course Withdrawal Policy. Retroactive grade changes are not made for students who have graduated. Undergraduate Final Grade Appeal Policy Revised and approved by the Faculty Senate on April 28, 2021. If a student wishes to appeal an assigned ﬁnal grade, the student should ﬁrst discuss the concerns with the instructor within 90 calendar days after the ﬁnal grade has been posted. If the student feels that policies were violated and not properly handled by the instructor, then the student will complete a grade appeal form housed in the Ofﬁce of the Dean of Undergraduate Studies. After consultation with this ofﬁce, the student may further appeal to the department head, the dean of the school or college, and the provost, in that order. Grade Appeals will be considered only in the most exceptional circumstances, and are approved only in cases where the evidence strongly supports the student’s claim. Please note that simple disagreement about what constitutes fair grading is not grounds for an appeal. Department or school handbooks and/or the instructor’s syllabus deﬁne standards for grading in any given course. When a student elects to remain in a class after reading these materials, the student is understood to have accepted the grading terms for the course. The instructor is not obligated to deviate from grading standards outlined in the department or school handbooks and/or the syllabus. Examples that do merit a ﬁnal grade appeal include: • The instructor has miscalculated a ﬁnal grade; • The instructor has violated the grading policies outlined in the syllabus without reasonable cause; • The instructor has not provided a reasonable explanation of how the student’s work was evaluated. Examples that do not merit a ﬁnal grade appeal include: • The instructor’s grading policies differ from other instructors in the department, college or school, or university. • The instructor’s Attendance Policy differs from other instructors in the department, college or school, or university. • The instructor’s Late Work Policy differs from other instructors in the department, college or school, or university. • The grade distribution in the class in question is lower than in other sections of the same course. • The student’s grade in the course is signiﬁcantly lower than grades the student earned in similar courses. • The grade in question will trigger academic probation, suspension, or dismissal, or will result in the loss of ﬁnancial aid eligibility. Departments and/or units are required to make available their grade appeal process online to make the process clear for students. Final grade appeal process should include department, unit, and university process with the timeline information found on the Ofﬁce of the Dean of Undergraduate Studies website. Honors for Second Degree Recipients and Transfer Students To maintain equity with students who have attended all four years at UNC Greensboro and who may have a semester GPA that would qualify them for honors, the following policy is in place: Any second degree candidate or degree candidate who transferred to UNC Greensboro from another institution is eligible for graduation with honors who, at the end of the ﬁnal year, has completed toward the degree (in the case of second degree students, toward the second degree) at least 45 credit hours of work in residence at UNC Greensboro and has earned the requisite grade point average. Majors, Minors, Double Majors and Simultaneous Degrees Policy Major The major is a ﬁeld of study in which a student must specialize in an academic discipline or interdisciplinary area of study by taking a minimum of 27 credit hours in a speciﬁed selection of courses in the subject matter(s) as a part of the requirements for completion of an undergraduate degree program.  All students must complete the requirements for at least one major, in addition to general education requirements, to successfully earn a bachelor's degree. The major appears on the transcript. All undergraduate degree-seeking students must meet the requirements to declare and be accepted into a major prior to the completion of 60 credits of credit. Transfer students entering with more than 60 credits must declare and be accepted into a major prior to registration of their ﬁrst term at UNC Greensboro. The student may declare the major in one of the following ways: • Upon completion of the initial undergraduate freshman, transfer, or international admissions application. • By formal request to the department of the new degree program. Concentration A concentration is a structured plan of study within select majors comprising a speciﬁed cluster of courses.  The requirements for a concentration are determined by the department.  The concentration appears on the transcript. Minor A minor represents an optional, secondary ﬁeld of study for a degree- seeking student; no student may declare a major and a minor in the same discipline. A minor requires additional coursework beyond what is already required for a related major. The minor appears on the transcript. Pre-Major A pre-major is a designated pathway for interested undergraduate students to gain entry into a UNC Greensboro undergraduate major/ degree program. A pre-major functions principally as an advising tool that helps departments guide interested students into required preparatory coursework and to advise them on any other major requirements. Acceptance or assignment into a pre-major does not guarantee acceptance into the associated major.  UNC Greensboro 2023-24 University Catalog 845 Preprofessional Programs UNC Greensboro offers all courses required for admission to certain professional schools.  The Pre-Professional Programs are not majors, but areas of interest.  Students must select another academic area as the major. Double Major A student who fulﬁlls the speciﬁed requirements for two different majors under a single degree program (e.g. B.A., B.S.) prior to graduation completes a double major. For example, a student may complete a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) with majors in Music and Political Science or a Bachelor of Science (B.S.) with majors in Psychology and Business Administration. The successful completion of prerequisite and curriculum requirements for both majors are required in order to complete the degree program with a double major. A student must declare a primary major and fulﬁll the General Education requirements of the primary major. For double majors, one diploma is issued and both majors are recorded on the student’s transcript. Simultaneous Degrees A student who fulﬁlls the speciﬁed requirements for distinct programs from different degrees prior to graduation will be awarded simultaneous degrees. For example, a student may complete a B.A. in Economics and a B.S. in Physics. Successful completion of prerequisite and curriculum requirements for each degree is required in order to complete both degrees. In order to graduate, the student must complete two graduation applications (one application for each degree). For students who receive simultaneous degrees, two diplomas are issued, and both degrees and majors are listed on the student’s transcript. The major selected for the additional simultaneous baccalaureate degree must be in a different academic discipline from that of the other simultaneous degree. Change of Degree Program, Major, Concentration, and/or Minor An undergraduate student may change the degree program which consists of major and/or concentration and/or minor and may enroll in a new degree program provided that the student meets the prerequisites for admission to the new degree program. See Student Catalog Year Policy for establishing the requirements for the changed degree. The change of degree program (major, concentration, or minor) must be requested through and approved by the department of the new degree program. The department will submit the approval to the University Registrar's Ofﬁce for processing. A student who has earned 60 or more credit hours cannot change his/her major to Exploratory/Undecided. Second Baccalaureate Degree Students who have previously earned bachelor’s degrees from UNC Greensboro or other accredited institutions may apply to a program leading to a second baccalaureate degree. The major selected for the second baccalaureate degree must be in a different academic discipline from that of the ﬁrst degree. Students seeking a second baccalaureate degree must: • Complete no fewer than 31 credits at UNC Greensboro within the second baccalaureate degree requirements. • Achieve a minimum grade point average of 2.0 on all work attempted toward the second degree. • Satisfy all requirements for the second degree. Students who hold a baccalaureate degree from an accredited institution will not be required to satisfy the UNC Greensboro General Education Requirements for the second degree. Baccalaureate Minor After Degree Awarded Students who have earned a bachelor’s degree from UNC Greensboro may not enroll in a program of study leading solely to a minor. Steps to Graduation By the beginning of the semester or summer session in which graduation is expected, undergraduates must ofﬁcially apply for graduation to the University Registrar. Fulﬁllment of all requirements for the degree applied for, as well as ofﬁcial application for the degree, are the student’s responsibilities. Academic Requirements Candidates for a baccalaureate degree must satisfy all of the speciﬁc requirements of UNC Greensboro and of the School/College and department in which they major. They must present for graduation the speciﬁc number of semester hours required for the degree with a minimum cumulative overall grade point average of at least 2.0 on all credits undertaken. At least 36 of the total credits for the degree must be at the 300 level or above. Graduation Requirements Students must complete the speciﬁc number of credits required for the degree with a minimum cumulative overall grade point average of at least 2.0 on all hours undertaken; at least 36 of the total credits for the degree must be at the 300 level or above; all students must complete at least 31 credits in residence at UNC Greensboro for the degree. Residence Requirements All students must complete at least 31 credits in residence at UNC Greensboro for the degree, 12 of which must be in the major ﬁeld and 9 of which must be in the minor if a minor is sought. After enrollment, Extension credit and Correspondence courses offered by UNC Greensboro  are considered residence credit; however, credit earned by special examination is not considered residence credit. Time Requirements Minerva's Academic Curriculum (MAC) and Communicating Ideas in Context (CIC) Requirements Minerva's Academic Curriculum (MAC) is UNC Greensboro's General Education program. Communicating Ideas in Context (CIC) are additional requirements that apply to College of Arts and Sciences majors. The following policies regard time allowed for completion of MAC and MAC + CIC requirements. The Ofﬁce of the University Registrar can provide additional details. Students must meet the General Education requirements and, if applicable, the College of Arts and Sciences additional requirements (CIC) for graduation as stated in this University Catalog in effect at the time of original enrollment at UNC Greensboro. If the student fails to graduate within seven years, however, the university * has the option of enforcing: 1. The original requirements, or 2. The MAC and CIC requirements in effect at the time the seven year period expired, or  846 Withdrawal from the University 3. The MAC and CIC requirements in effect at the time of re-enrollment if the student withdrew. * Typically, the UNC Greensboro Ofﬁce of the University Registrar will make the choice among these options in consultation with the department in which the student chooses to major. Major Requirements Students must meet the departmental major requirements in effect when the student declares or, if required by the department, is formally admitted to a school/college major. If the student fails to graduate within seven years, however, the university* has the option of enforcing: 1. The original requirements, 2. The major requirements in effect at the time the seven year period expired, or 3. The major requirements in effect at the time of re-enrollment if the student withdrew. * Typically, the department in which the student chooses to major will make the choice among these options in consultation with the UNC Greensboro Ofﬁce of the Dean of Undergraduate Studies. Application for Graduation All undergraduate students are required to ﬁle an application for graduation with the University Registrar’s Ofﬁce at the beginning of the semester in which they plan to graduate. The online degree application is available via UNCGenie. This application is required for processing the ﬁnal degree audit and for printing diplomas. See the topic Miscellaneous Fees and Expenses in the Expenses, Payments, and Refunds section. The fee is nonrefundable. The deadline dates for ﬁling are also published each year in the Academic Calendar and on the University Registrar’s Ofﬁce website. Students who do not graduate in the semester for which they ﬁle a graduation application must reﬁle for the next term in which they expect to complete their degrees. Applications are accepted for a short period of time beyond the published deadlines in order to allow for extenuating circumstances; however, once the application for a term is disabled and deemed closed, students must apply to graduate for the next available term. These deadlines are not negotiable as notiﬁcation of the candidates for graduation are submitted to the Board of Trustees for ofﬁcial action shortly after the deadline dates for ﬁling each term. Graduation with Latin Honors Graduation with Latin honors is based on all courses (including the last semester’s work) for which grades and grade points are given. Any senior is eligible for honors who, at the end of the senior year, has completed at least 45 credits of work in residence at UNC Greensboro. This does not include hours for which credit and grade points have been received by special examinations. Honors information printed in the commencement program is based on course work completed through the previous semester, as is the list provided for the purchase of honor cords. Latin honors are awarded to graduating seniors as follows: Summa cum laude (with highest honor) achievement of a minimum grade point average of 3.90 Magna cum laude (with great honor) achievement of a minimum grade point average of 3.70 Cum laude (with honor) achievement of a minimum grade point average of 3.50 Commencement Ceremonies Commencement ceremonies are held in May and December of each year; there is no formal ceremony in August. The names of August degree recipients are printed in the December commencement program and listed on the University Registrar’s Ofﬁce website. Visit http://commencementcentral.uncg.edu for information about the commencement ceremonies. Commencement Participation Policy Approved by the Chancellor, February 19, 2003 Students completing all degree requirements by the end of the spring semester are encouraged to participate in May Commencement. Students completing degree requirements by the end of the fall semester are encouraged to participate in the December Commencement. There is no ceremony in August for summer graduates. Students completing degree requirements by the end of the Summer Session may participate in either the May (preceding the completion of the summer term) or the December (following the completion of the summer term) commencement ceremony by applying to graduate for the summer term, paying the graduation fee, and completing the RSVP form found at http://commencementcentral.uncg.edu. Note that the names of August graduates appear only in the December commencement program. Please note: Degree candidates will neither earn degrees nor be graduated from the university until they have completed all degree requirements. Participation in a commencement ceremony does not presume graduation from the university. Students who do not apply for graduation before the published deadline for any semester must apply for graduation during the next semester. Students who have applied for graduation but fail to meet the requirements must reapply for graduation by the published deadline for the semester in which they will fulﬁll the requirements. Degrees are conferred only after all requirements are completed and the Board of Trustees has taken ofﬁcial action. Visit http://commencementcentral.uncg.edu for information about the commencement ceremonies. Withdrawal from the University Undergraduate students who ﬁnd that they must withdraw from the university can do so by withdrawing from all courses through UNCGenie. Undergraduates who withdraw from all courses are considered to be withdrawn from the university and must seek reactivation or readmission through Undergraduate Admissions to return to school in subsequent terms. Students withdrawing from the university within the ﬁrst eight weeks of the term will be indicated on the transcript with a grade of WT (Withdrawn - Total). All WT courses count as attempted hours and are subject to ﬁnancial aid and Satisfactory Academic Progression rules and  UNC Greensboro 2023-24 University Catalog 847 calculations; they do not count in academic standing calculations or GPA calculation.  848 Undergraduate Requirements Undergraduate Requirements • General Education Program (p. 848) • Student Learning Outcomes Assessments (p. 849) • Undergraduate Degrees and Degree Requirements (p. 849) General Education Program Minerva’s Academic Curriculum (MAC) mac.uncg.edu (https://success.uncg.edu/undergraduate-studies/ minervas-academic-curriculum/) Minerva's Academic Curriculum (MAC) focuses on the development of eleven foundational competencies (in 33–34 credit hours) that are important for learning in college and life. MAC courses represent a wide range of academic ﬁelds that will introduce students to discoveries of the past and to cutting-edge research that's happening on campus. Through MAC coursework, undergraduate students will engage in learning experiences to achieve 11 competencies across disciplines, totaling 33– 34 credit hours depending on individual course hour structure. Other requirements and opportunities in the major program, the minor program (if applicable), and the total undergraduate experience build on the foundation of MAC courses and contribute to the attainment of these goals. Competencies and Requirements Foundations Requirement: 3 credits Schedule Attribute: MAC Foundations Foundations courses connect students to the campus community by combining university transition content, information literacy, and transferable skills to facilitate academic and personal development.

Most courses meeting this requirement will include a laboratory section, so students can have adequate hands- on experience working with data in context. Students Transferring to UNC Greensboro Please refer to the Comprehensive Articulation Agreement topic on Course Credit Regulations and Limits page of the Academic Regulations and Policies section (p. 838). Students who transfer to UNC Greensboro will automatically have their transcripts evaluated for equivalency with MAC. Students can also petition to have particular transfer courses evaluated for particular competencies, via the General Education Petition for Transfer Credit. Questions may be directed to the Ofﬁce of the Dean of Undergraduate Studies. A North Carolina community college student who satisfactorily completes, with a grade of ""C"" or better, courses identiﬁed in the Universal General Education Transfer Component will receive credit applied toward the MAC course requirements. Student Learning Outcomes Assessments UNC Greensboro requires students to participate in student learning outcomes assessments from time to time prior to their graduation. Most of these activities consist of in-class assessments. However, students may also be invited to complete tests measuring other learning outcomes such as information literacy or critical thinking. These tests may occur outside of the classroom and at different times in a student’s career. Scores on these tests are not used to evaluate students on an individual basis, but are used to evaluate learning across the university’s programs. Participation is expected. Undergraduate Degrees and Degree Requirements Undergraduate Degrees UNC Greensboro offers six baccalaureate degrees: • B.A. Bachelor of Arts • B.F.A. Bachelor of Fine Arts • B.M. Bachelor of Music • B.S. Bachelor of Science • B.S.N. Bachelor of Science in Nursing • B.S.W. Bachelor of Social Work Requirements for a Bachelor’s Degree A bachelor’s degree from UNC Greensboro is awarded to a student who has met the following requirements: 1. Successful completion of a minimum of 120 credit hours, distributed as follows: a. General Education Program—Minerva's Academic Curriculum (MAC): 33–34 credits b. Additional College/School requirements c. Major subject and related areas: as required by program d. Electives: as required by program Total minimum credits: 120 2. A grade point average on the credits attempted of not less than 2.0 3. At least 36 credits of courses at the 300 course level or above 4. At least 31 credits in residence at UNC Greensboro, 12 of which must be in the major ﬁeld and nine (9) of which must be in the minor if a minor is sought The College of Arts and Sciences and each of the ﬁve professional academic units—Joseph M. Bryan School of Business and Economics; School of Education; School of Health and Human Sciences; School of Nursing; and the College of Visual and Performing Arts—have structured their individual degree programs to comply with this all-university degree framework. Average Time To Graduation Many factors affect both the length of time and the number of credit hours an individual student will require to complete the baccalaureate degree. Full-time undergraduate students are expected to complete at least 12 credit hours per semester. Failure to complete an average of 15 credits per semester may lengthen the student’s time to graduation. Some majors do require formal admission beyond that required for admission to the university in general. Students should meet with their academic advisors regularly to plan their academic schedules. To graduate, students must complete speciﬁc university requirements as well as requirements within the major. Students who change majors may ﬁnd that additional requirements must be fulﬁlled. Changing majors excessively, or after the third or fourth semester of study, may also lengthen the time to graduation. Criteria for admission to a speciﬁc major (outlined in the University Catalog) and continuation in that major may include a university grade point average exceeding that required for continuation within the university as a whole. Students considering such majors should become familiar with the guidelines, and work with an academic advisor, as soon as possible to ensure that they meet the criteria. Changes In Degree Requirements And Other Regulations The University reserves the right to make changes as required in course offerings, curricula, academic policies, and other rules and regulations affecting students, to be effective whenever determined by the University. These changes will govern current and formerly enrolled students. Enrollment of all students is subject to these conditions.  850 University Policies University Policies • Academic Integrity Policy (p. 850) • Auditing Courses (p. 850) • Class Attendance (p. 850) • Copyright Compliance Policy (p. 851) • Discriminatory Conduct Policy (p. 851) • Drug and Alcohol Policy and Operational Procedures (p. 852) • Dual Registration as Undergraduate and Graduate (p. 852) • Immunization Clearance (p. 852) • Online Sections and Online Programs Policy (p. 852) • Sexual Harassment (Title IX Policy) (p. 852) • Student Catalog Year Policy (p. 852) • Student Code of Conduct (p. 853) • University Directory Information (p. 853) • Withdrawal for Students Called to Active Military Duty (p. 853) Academic Integrity Policy First responsibility for academic integrity lies with individual students and faculty members of the UNC Greensboro community.

Speciﬁc information on the Academic Integrity Policy and obligations of faculty and students may be found online at http://academicintegrity.uncg.edu (http:// academicintegrity.uncg.edu/). Names of College and School members of the Academic Integrity Advisory Group may be found online at this site as well. For more information, please contact the Ofﬁce of Student Rights and Responsibilities at 336-334-4640. Auditing Courses Current UNC Greensboro students may audit courses upon the written approval of the instructor. Auditors must register ofﬁcially for the class. Attendance, preparation, and participation in the classroom discussion and laboratory exercises shall be at the discretion of the instructor. An auditor is not required to take examinations and tests and receives no credit for the course. Registration may not be changed from audit to credit or from credit to audit status after the end of schedule adjustment. A full-time UNC Greensboro student (registered for 12 or more credit hours) may audit one course per semester without an additional fee. A part-time UNC Greensboro student (registered for fewer than 12 credits) may audit no more than two courses per semester and is charged a $15.00 fee for each audited course. See the Auditors topic in the Admission to the University section for auditing options other than current UNC Greensboro students. Class Attendance Regular class attendance is a responsibility and a privilege of university education. It is fundamental to the orderly acquisition of knowledge. Students should recognize the advantages of regular class attendance, accept it as a personal responsibility, and apprise themselves of the consequences of poor attendance. Instructors should stress the importance of these responsibilities to students, set appropriate class attendance policies for their classes, and inform students of their requirements in syllabi and orally at the beginning of each term. Student’s Responsibility 1. Knowledge of each instructor’s attendance policy and monitoring his or her class absences throughout the term. 2. Familiarity with all materials covered in each course during absences and make-up of any work required by the instructor. 3. Inform each instructor as far in advance as possible when conflicts or absences can be anticipated (e.g., athletic team events, work, medical procedures, religious observances, etc.) by e-mail, phone, or by contacting the main ofﬁce of the department that offers the course. 4. Provide appropriate documentation so that each instructor can make an informed decision as to whether or not the absence is excusable. 5. Initiation of requests to make-up work missed because of class absences. The decision to assist the student with make-up work, including tests, rests with the instructor. 6. Follow-up on all notices from the Registrar regarding course enrollment in order to correct registration. Instructor’s Responsibility 1. Setting of reasonable regulations for class attendance as appropriate for class content, organization, methodology, and size. 2. Description of attendance policies in course syllabi and announcement in class, particularly at the beginning of each term. 3. Maintenance of class attendance records of enrolled students as appropriate for the attendance policy. 4. Exaction of penalties for unsatisfactory class attendance. Possible penalties are lowering the course grade, including a grade of F, and, in extreme circumstances, dropping the student from the course. Dean of Students Ofﬁce Responsibility 1. Notify each instructor on the student’s behalf when personal reasons (e.g., family emergency, illness, bereavement, birth of a child, military duty, etc.) prevent the student from properly notifying each instructor because of circumstances beyond the student’s control. The student or the student’s representative should contact the Dean of Students Ofﬁce (336-334-5514) if the student is unable to make direct contact by e-mail or phone with each instructor or is unable to leave word with each instructor’s department. 2. Review documentation by a licensed health professional and conﬁrm its receipt with each instructor if the student experiences a medical or psychological event that signiﬁcantly impairs their ability to function successfully or safely as a student. The student should be aware that assistance of the Dean of Students Ofﬁce does not change in any way the outcome of the instructor’s decision regarding the student’s academic work, grades and performance in any given course. Religious Observance Approved by the Ofﬁce of the Provost, August 2010 1. The university allows for a limited number of excused absences each academic year for religious observances required by the faith of the student. 2. Students must notify instructors of absences in advance of the date of the religious observance. Instructors have the authority to specify, via written notice to students, the amount of lead time required and  UNC Greensboro 2023-24 University Catalog 851 may require that the nature of the religious observance be speciﬁed and the student’s participation be conﬁrmed in writing by an ofﬁcial of the religious organization. 3. When appropriate notice is provided by a student, the student must be granted at least two excused absences per academic year under this policy and must be allowed to make up or waive work and tests missed due to these particular absences. With regard to any test or other assignment that a student would miss due to notice of a required religious observance, faculty members may require the student to complete the test or assignment in advance of the originally scheduled date of the test or assignment. Beyond the minimum terms and limits of this policy, instructors maintain authority to establish and enforce the attendance policy for the courses they are teaching. 4. The requirement for students to make such requests for excused absences applies only to days when the university is holding class. Appeals If a student thinks there is a discrepancy between the instructor’s exaction of a penalty for unsatisfactory class attendance and the stated policy or that there is an extenuating circumstance that may affect the instructor’s decision, then he or she should ﬁrst make a request to the instructor. If desired, the student may further appeal to the Department Head, the Dean of the School or College, and the Provost, in that order. Cancellation for Non-Attendance In circumstances in which a student was charged for or received a grade for a class that they never attended, the student should request a Cancellation of Course(s) for Non-Attendance through the University Registrar’s Ofﬁce. The student is responsible for demonstrating eligibility for cancellation under this policy. Cancellations cannot be processed for students who attended a class, even one time. (Important note: Class attendance for online courses is tracked based on a student’s log-in records and activity in Canvas or relevant online Learning Management System). Requests for Cancellation of Course(s) for Non-Attendance must be submitted within one year of the term in which the courses were taken. No cancellations will be made once a student has been awarded a degree for a course on record previous to that degree’s award. Once veriﬁed with instructors, all requested courses will be removed from a student’s registration and will not display on a transcript.

University Directory Information The University Registrar’s Ofﬁce maintains student demographic data and provides it for the online University Directory. Release of Student Directory Information Unless a student requests in writing to the contrary, federal law permits the university to release Directory Information to the public without the student’s consent.

At UNC Greensboro, Directory Information consists of: • Student’s ﬁrst and last name • Major ﬁeld of study • Dates of attendance • Enrollment status • Anticipated graduation date • Degrees awarded • Awards (including scholarships) Additionally, UNC Greensboro designates some information as Limited- Use Directory Information. The use and disclosure of this information is restricted to: (1) university ofﬁcials who have access, consistent with FERPA, to such information and only in conjunction with a legitimate educational interest and (2) external parties contractually afﬁliated with the university, provided such afﬁliation requires the sharing of Limited- Use Directory Information. Limited-Use Directory Information consists of: • Local and permanent address • Student e-mail address • County, state, or US territory from which the student originally enrolled • Telephone numbers • Participation in ofﬁcially recognized activities and sports • Weight and height of members of athletic teams • The most recent previous educational agency attended by the student Suppression of Student Directory Information Under the 1974 Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), the student has the right to request in writing that the disclosure of this information be withheld from persons outside the university. Please note that this information can only be suppressed from the public, not from university ofﬁcials. The suppression request includes both Directory Information and Limited-Use Directory Information as deﬁned by UNC Greensboro policy. A student must ﬁle a form requesting suppression of information with the University Registrar’s Ofﬁce. A request to suppress information must be ﬁled while the student is still enrolled at the university. Once a student’s information is suppressed, it will not be printed in the Commencement Program upon the student’s graduation, without the student’s written consent. The suppression of information remains in effect until revoked in writing by the student, even after the student is no longer enrolled at the university. Former students may request in writing that earlier suppression requests be revoked. Parents’ Information Information concerning parents of students (names, addresses, phone numbers, etc.) is not made available as it is not considered directory information. Release of Grades and GPA Information Grades and grade point averages are never released to agencies or persons outside the university without the written consent of the student, unless otherwise provided for by law. Grades and GPA information are not given out over the telephone. Withdrawal for Students Called to Active Military Duty Military Call-Up Policy Leaving Prior to the Completion of a Term A student voluntarily or involuntarily called for active military duty in the Armed Services Reserve or the National Guard is eligible to elect one of the following options for leaving prior to the completion of a term: A. Complete Withdrawal Option (without academic penalty) • Tuition and general fees are fully refundable. • Health fees are generally fully refundable, except for students who have used UNC Greensboro health services. These students would be billed at the service rate to a maximum charge equivalent to the health fee. Students who have enrolled in the Student Health Insurance program should contact the Agent for information on a pro- rated refund of premium. • Room and board is refunded based on the number of weeks the room is occupied and the meals consumed. • The student is still responsible for all miscellaneous charges such as library ﬁnes, parking tickets, health service charges, etc. In order to be eligible for a refund under these guidelines, the student must contact the University Registrar’s Ofﬁce and provide the following: • a copy of his or her call-up papers; these serve as documentation for the refund of tuition and fees  854 Withdrawal for Students Called to Active Military Duty • a mailing address to which the student would like the refund to be sent The University Registrar’s Ofﬁce will notify appropriate ofﬁces of the student’s withdrawal including Undergraduate Studies, the Graduate School, Financial Aid Ofﬁce, Housing and Residence Life, and the Cashiers and Student Accounts Ofﬁce. In order for a student living in UNC Greensboro housing to receive a refund from the Department of Housing and Residence Life, room keys must be returned to the appropriate ofﬁce. If a student is receiving ﬁnancial aid when called to active duty, ﬁnancial aid must be repaid according to federal and state guidelines before a refund will be issued by the UNC Greensboro. B. Early Exam Option A student who is required to report for military duty not earlier than four calendar weeks prior to the date a semester ends as stated in the ofﬁcial catalog of the UNC Greensboro (or after completion of at least 75% of the enrollment period in a non-standard semester) may, when authorized by the instructor, take the ﬁnal exam early and be given full credit for all courses that have an average grade of C or better. Students are not eligible for refunds for which they receive credit. C. Incomplete Grade Option A student who is required to report for military duty prior to the completion of a term may take a grade of incomplete in a course and complete it upon release from active duty. Course completion may be accomplished by independent study or by retaking the course without payment of tuition and fees. Under federal ﬁnancial aid policies, a course that is retaken in this manner may not be counted toward a student’s enrollment load. An eligible student who receives an incomplete for any course is not entitled to a refund of tuition or fees paid. Returning to UNC Greensboro Within the Same Term A student called for active duty and subsequently released within the time frame to re-enroll during the semester of withdrawal may pursue re- enrollment within the same term. UNC Greensboro will make every effort to accommodate the request. Individual contacts with faculty involved will determine appropriateness of returning to a course. Returning to UNC Greensboro at the Start of a New Term A student voluntarily or involuntarily called for active military duty in the Armed Services, Armed Services Reserves, or the National Guard who wants to return to UNC Greensboro must submit an application for readmission to UNC Greensboro Undergraduate Admissions. The returning student is eligible to have the application fee waived if: 1. The student selects the option to pay by check during the application process. 2. The student notiﬁes the UNC Greensboro VA Certifying Ofﬁcial of the intent to return and provides a copy of orders, conﬁrming dates of call to active duty. The re-enrolled student is technically ineligible to participate in early registration for the term of re-enrollment; however, UNC Greensboro will arrange a priority window to assist the student in returning with appropriate classes that are applicable toward the ﬁeld of study.
